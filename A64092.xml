            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT may not be unknown to thoſe that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in Books and Pamphlets publiſhed during the late unhappy times, that all the Treatiſes (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Patriarcha</hi>) which are the ſubject of the enſuing <hi>Obſervations,</hi> were publiſhed at firſt in ſingle Tracts without Name, though they have ſince come out under that of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> Baronet, deceaſed: All which, though I hope they might be written with an honeſt deſigne, and in defence of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of his then Majeſties lawful and juſt Rights, then trampled upon by a domineering Faction, and may contain ſome things uſeful enough to confute divers levelling Notions then too much in faſhion; yet whilſt this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (as violent men commonly do) ran into the other extream, and muſt needs aſſert an Abſolute Monarchy <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> ſo that no other Government can be lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, nor the leaſt Limitations ſet to it, without Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and diminution of that Soveraignty which is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from no leſs an Original than God himſelf; and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that Princes can ever be obliged by any Fundamental, or after-Contracts, or Conceſſions, or by any Coronation-Oaths, to abſtain from the Lives, Liberties, or Properties of their Subjects, farther than as they themſelves ſhall think it convenient; ſo that there can be no ſuch thing in nature as a Tyrant: I leave it to the judgment of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader, whether what this Author might deſigne
<pb facs="tcp:50833:3"/> as Phyſick, hath not ſerved rather to inflame the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and whether he hath not by ſuch raſh and ill-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Aſſertions, given too much advantage to the Enemies of Kingſhip to retort, That ſince all Government was ordained by God for the good of Mankind, that could never be of divine inſtitution which would render all things to be ſo much the Princes Right, that the Subjects can claim a Property in nothing which he ſhall pleaſe to take from them; and that however they uſe them, yet they ſtill exerciſe but their own Royal Rights and Prerogatives. So that by thus taking away all diſtinctions between Kings and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and between Slaves and Subjects, I fear that (like <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s harſh Anſwer to his Peoples Complaints) he hath not given many of his Readers a prejudice againſt that Government, which temper'd by known Laws, I take to be the beſt in the World.</p>
            <p>For as Superſtition can never ſerve to advance the true Worſhip of God, but by creating falſe Notions of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature in mens minds, or render it not as it ought to be, the Object of their Love and Reverence, but ſervile Fear; ſo I ſuppoſe this aſſerting of ſuch an unlimited Power in all Monarchs, and ſuch an entire Subjection as this Author exacts from Subjects, can produce nothing but a Slaviſh Dread, without that Reverence, Eſteem, and Affection for their Princes Perſon and Government which is ſo neceſſary for the quiet of Princes, and which they will have, whilſt they believe he thinks himſelf obliged in Conſcience and Honour to protect their Lives and Fortunes from Slavery and Oppreſſion, according to juſt and known Laws: And that contrary Notions of this Supreme Power, are ſo far from ſetling mens minds in a ſober and rational Obedience to Government, that they rather make them deſperate and careleſs who is their Maſter, ſince let what change will come, they are ſure to be no better than Slaves, as may be ſeen in all the Abſolute Monarchies from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may alſo conſider whether moſt of the Arguments
<pb facs="tcp:50833:3"/> this Author makes uſe of for abſolute Obedience to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as repreſenting the lawful Prince and Father of the People, might not ſerve for the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Oliver</hi> and the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> as well as a lawful Soveraign; ſince I am ſure <hi>Milton</hi> makes uſe of the ſame places of Scripture for this purpoſe, which this Author and <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> do for another.</p>
            <p>So that moſt moderate men, nay, the Author's own Friends, may wiſh that either theſe Treatiſes had never been publiſhed, or at leaſt have been left in private Studies and Book-ſellers ſhops, amongſt thoſe heaps of Pamphlets condemned to duſt and oblivion; ſince no man can imagine to what end this <hi>Patriarcha</hi> and other Tracts ſhould come out at ſuch a <hi>Time</hi> as they did, unleſs the Publiſhers thought that theſe Pieces, which printed apart could onely ſerve to enſnare the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of ſome unthinking Country-Gentleman or Windblown-Theologue, could do no leſs, being twiſted into one Volume, than bind the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and enſlave the Reaſons of all his unwary Readers.</p>
            <p>Since therefore ſhort Treatiſes of this kind, written in a gentile ſtile, and a formal appearance of Law and Reaſon, do more miſchief among young men, and thoſe that have not leiſure to look much into the grounds of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, than tedious Volumes: And that this Notion of the Divine and Patriarchal Right of abſolute Monarchy hath obtain'd ſo much among ſome modern Church-men, who cry it up as their <hi>Diana,</hi> and conſequently hath ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, that are the Seminaries where the Youth of this Nation do commonly receive Principles both in Religion and Politicks, which if they have not a mind large enough to overcome the prejudices of Education, will miſ-lead them as long as they live, and ſo make them deſire at leaſt to alter that Government, and give up thoſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which their Anceſtors were ſo careful to preſerve and deliver down to Poſterity: I thought my ſelf obliged (having perhaps more leiſure, though leſs parts and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:50833:4"/> than a great many others) to do God, my King, and Country this ſervice, as to lay open the weakneſs of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the dangerous conſequences of this Author's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And though men of greater abilities may either diſpiſe ſuch weak Arguments as this Author makes uſe of, or elſe think it below them to ſpend ſo much time from their more uſeful and beneficial Employments, and that indeed his Reaſons are not ſo knotty or intricate, that they require any more than honeſt ſence and plain Engliſh to lay them open to the unprejudiced Reader; yet ſince the Poyſon hath ſpread ſo far among the men of Letters, and in the Country among divers of the Gentry and Clergie, I thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to do my weak endeavour to undeceive them: And in ſo doing, I deſire to be thought no other than what I really am, a zealous aſſertor and defender of the Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht by Law; being ſo far from a Commonwealths-man, that for my own part I reverence Monarchy above all other forms of Government, and ſhould be as willing to have it unmixt (it being that by which God Almighty governs the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe) could humane nature be long truſted with it, and could we be as certain that his Vicegerents on Earth would as eaſily imitate thoſe divine Attributes of wiſdom and goodneſs, as they are prone to lay claim to his abſolute Power. For as where thoſe Perfections direct the Scepter, a Prince is to be loved and reverenced as the beſt Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the divine nature; ſo the exerciſe of an abſolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power, without theſe, can create no other Idea in mens minds, than what the barbarous <hi>Indians</hi> have of thoſe terrible Gods they worſhip, to whom though they often make Oblations of what is deareſt to them, yet it is upon no higher motive of Devotion, than that they thereby hope to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole them not to do them any miſchief, and would ſoon caſt them off if they knew how to get rid of them. Therefore the fault is not in the Government as abſolute, but in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, which is not often found ſufficient, at leaſt for above one or two Succeſſions, to ſupport and manage ſo
<pb facs="tcp:50833:4"/> unlimited a Power in one ſingle perſon as it ought to be. And for this I deſire the Reader to look over the Catalogue of all the <hi>Perſian, Roman,</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monarchs that have ever ſucceeded in ſo many hundreds of years, and ſee how many good ones they will finde among them, and who truly conſidered the good and proſperity of that Empire which God had truſted them withal; the effects of which abſolute Power being very well known to the Satyriſt who lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, when he thus ſhrewdly obſerves:
<q>
                  <l>— Nihil eſt quod credere de ſe</l>
                  <l>Non poſſit, cum laudatur Diis aequa poteſtas.</l>
                  <bibl>Juven. Sat. 4.</bibl>
               </q> And how much Chriſtian Religion hath altered the caſe, I deſire all obſerving Readers to conſult the late Hiſtories of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and other deſpotick Governments in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince the Government of this Nation, as now eſtabliſht, I conceive the beſt in its kind, as moſt equal and beneficial both to the Prince and People; ſo that it is onely their faults who would go off from it, if they are not both Prince and People the happieſt in the World: I hope I may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, wiſh thoſe accurſed from God, who would remove our ancient Land-marks, and pull up all Limits between Prerogative and Law; and who (as it may juſtly be feared) would miſ-lead Princes, enſlave Mankind, and (if occaſion were) ſacrifice both to their own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Ambition. The like I may ſay of thoſe who would deſtroy this ancient Government, and ſet up a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy amongſt us; ſince I know not which is worſt, to be knawn to death by Rats, or devoured by a Lion.</p>
            <p>Nor is it that I am conſcious to my ſelf of having writ any thing in theſe enſuing ſheets contrary to Law, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Government, or that Obedience which all good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects owe their Prince and his Laws, which hath made me forbear prefixing my Name to this Treatiſe; ſince perhaps ſome of thoſe Motives which might perſwade this Author to forbear it in the Treatiſes he publiſhed, might likewiſe
<pb facs="tcp:50833:5"/> have the ſame effect upon me; eſpecially ſince I doubt not but what I have here written will provoke thoſe Craftſmen who eſteem this Notion of our Authors (by which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to get both Riches and Honour) as the <hi>Diana</hi> that fell down from <hi>Jupiter:</hi> And therefore it is no wonder if they are angry with any man that ſhould go about to pull off the ſpecious Vails with which they have covered it, and ſhew it (as it really is) a wooden Idol of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and if they knew the man, would, according to the uſual courſe of thoſe who abound more in Malice than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, quit the matter, and fall upon the perſon of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, and endeavour to ſtir up both the great Vulgar and the ſmall Vulgar (as Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> ingeniouſly terms men of Title without Senſe.)</p>
            <p>Beſides all which, joyn'd with the ſmall opinion I have of my own performances, or that I think theſe Papers capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to tranſmit my Name to Poſterity; yet if I were ſure I could do it, however writing againſt an ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man long ſince deceaſed (and whoſe good Name upon all accounts I deſigne not to diminiſh) yet I ſhould not think it generous to raiſe my ſelf a Fame to the prejudice of another mans: And therefore my Requeſt to you is, That you would believe I write theſe <hi>Obſcrvations</hi> for no other end than for the Truth, and in defence of the Government as it is eſtabliſht, and the juſt Rights and Liberties of all true Engliſh-men. All which, I pray God preſerve as long as the Sun and Moon endure.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>THE reaſon why I chuſe to begin theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations with this Treatiſe of the natural Right of Kings, rather than with any of the reſt, though publiſhed long before it, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being (as I ſuppoſe) writ after the reſt, and on purpoſe to aſſert Monarchy to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> is likely to contain the Authors moſt mature thoughts; and being written with better connection than his other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50833:6"/> Tracts, contains the ſubſtance of them all; which were deſigned not ſo much to eſtabliſh an Hypotheſis, as to obſerve the weakneſs of other mens: and being publiſhed at ſeveral times, and on divers occaſions, give us but the ſame Notions repeated, according as the Tenets in the Authors he writ againſt needed (as he thought) a Confutation: Which how far they do deſerve it, I leave to the Reader to judge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not take upon me to defend any mans Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, though never ſo great or learned, farther than I conceive them agreeable to right Reaſon. Nor ſhall I trouble my ſelf to criticize on every ſmall Errour or Miſtake in this Author's Writings, but onely ſet my ſelf to conſider ſuch main Arguments as appear to be founded on falſe or meer precarious Principles; not concerning my ſelf with his other Treatiſes, but as they contain ſome other Reaſons or newer Matter than I finde here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 2. The deſigne of this Treatiſe, is againſt an Opinion maintained by ſome Divines, and ſeveral learned men, That Mankind is naturally endowed and born with Freedom from Subjection, and at liberty to chuſe what form of Government it pleaſe; and that the Power which any one man hath over others, was at firſt beſtowed according to the diſcretion of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. <hi>Page</hi> 3. This Opinion, he ſays, is not to be found in the Fathers of the Primitive Church: that it contradicts the Doctrine and Hiſtory of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the conſtant practice of all ancient Monarchies, and the very Principles of the Law of Nature. And upon this Doctrine the Jeſuits, and favourers of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Diſcipline, have built this perilous Concluſion: That the People or Multitude have power to puniſh or deprive the Prince, if he tranſgreſs the Laws of the Kingdom. And for this quotes the Writings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Jeſuits.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50833:6"/>
               <p>How far this Tenet deſerves the Author's Cenſure, and is liable to the Concluſions he ſays ſome have drawn from thence, ſince the truth or falſhood of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions does not depend upon the men that have made uſe of them, I ſhall conſider hereafter; now confining my ſelf onely to examine the Reaſons he brings either in this or any other of his Treatiſes to overthrow this Opinion. And if they prove weak, and inſufficient for the end the Author deſigned them, ſome Friend of his, or his Tenets, had beſt finde out others; which if they prove and appear evidently true, I ſhall then reſt ſatisfied, and acknowledge my ſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely convinced. In the mean time I ſhall now give you the Author's Hypotheſis all at once, in his words, that you may judge whether I deal fairly with him or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 5. To paſs over therefore his Cautions (which are honeſt and ſober) I ſhall come to what he obſerves upon ſeveral paſſages of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> And though he does not quote the places from whence he took them, yet I hope he hath dealt fairly with him: Though I ſhall not take upon me to defend the contradictions or falſe conſequences either of this or any other Author, ſince I onely obſerve the onely Anſwer which (<hi>p.</hi> 11.) Sir <hi>R. F.</hi> gives <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Argument for the natural Liberty of the People, is out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, whoſe words are theſe: <hi>If many men had been created together out of the Earth, they ought all to have been Princes over their Poſterity. In which words</hi> (the Author ſays) <hi>we have an evident confeſſion, that Creation made Man Prince of his Poſterity. And indeed not onely</hi> Adam, <hi>but the ſucceeding Patriarchs had by right of Fatherhood, Royal Authority over their Children. Nor dares</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>deny this. That the Patriarchs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were endowed with Kingly power, their deeds do teſtifie; for as</hi> Adam <hi>was Lord of his Children, ſo his Children, under him, had a Command and Power over their own Children:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50833:7"/> but ſtill with a ſubordination to the firſt Parent, who was Lord Paramount over his Childrens Children to all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as being the Grandfather of his People.</hi> Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> though it may deſtroy his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for natural Freedom, yet I conceive that it does not deſtroy the neceſſity of ſuppoſing all the Kingdoms and Commonwealths now in being in the world, to have had their beginning from Conqueſt, or elſe from the Conſent or Inſtitution of the People who began it; as I ſhall endeavour to prove more at large.</p>
               <p>But from this conceſſion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s, the Author taking this as a yielded point, proceeds thus: <hi>P.</hi> 12. <hi>I do not ſee how the Children of</hi> Adam, <hi>or any man elſe, can be free from Subjection to their Parents: And this Subjection of Children being the Fountain of all Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by the Ordination of God himſelf, it follows, That Civil Power not onely in general is by Divine Inſtitution, but even the Aſſignment of it ſpecifically to the eldeſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Which quite takes away that new and common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which refers onely Power <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal and Abſolute to God; but Power Reſpective, in regard of the ſpecial Form of Government, to the Choice of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 13. <hi>This Lordſhip which</hi> Adam <hi>by command had over the whole World, and by right deſcending from him, the Patriarchs did enjoy, was as large and ample as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteſt Dominion of any Monarch which hath been ſince the Creation. For Power of Life and Death, we finde that</hi> Judah <hi>the Father pronounced ſentence of death againſt</hi> Thamar <hi>his Daughter-in-law for playing the Harlot;</hi> Bring her forth <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that ſhe may be burnt. <hi>Touching War, we ſee that</hi> Abram <hi>commanded an Army of</hi> 318 <hi>Souldiers of his own Family; and</hi> Eſau <hi>met his brother</hi> Jacob <hi>with</hi> 400 <hi>men at Arms. For matter of Peace,</hi> Abraham <hi>made a League with</hi> Abimelech, <hi>and ratified the Articles with an Oath. Theſe Acts of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in capital Crimes, of making War, and concluding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50833:7"/> Peace, are the chiefeſt Marks of Soveraignty that are found in any Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And not onely until the Flood, but after it, this Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal power did continue, as the very name</hi> Patriarch <hi>doth in part prove. The three Sons of</hi> Noah <hi>had the whole World divided amongſt them by their Father; for of them was the whole World overſpread, according to the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction given to him and his Sons:</hi> Be fruitful, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and repleniſh the earth.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds upon a vulgar Opinion, <hi>p.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>That at the Confuſion of Tongues, there were</hi> 72 <hi>diſtinct Nations erected, not as confuſed Multitudes, without Heads or Governours, but they were diſtinct Families which had Fathers for Rulers over them: whereby it appears, that even in the Confuſion, God was careful to preſerve Paternal Authority, by diſtributing the diverſity of Languages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of Families.</hi> And for this he quotes the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. v. 5. Speaking of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Iſles of the Gentiles among the Sons of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Theſe are the Families of the Sons of</hi> Noah, <hi>after their Generations in their Nations; and by theſe were theſe Nations divided in the Earth after the Flood. So that though the manner of this Diviſion be uncertain, yet it is moſt certain the Diviſion it ſelf was by Families from</hi> Noah <hi>and his Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 16. As for <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s being King over his own Family by Right, and over other Families by Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conqueſt, and not by Election of the People or Multitude, he gives us Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it was ſo; (which I think is no better a proof than if he had given us his own:) but if it were true, it proves no more, than that this Patriarchal Right could not long continue, ſince it was uſurped in the Grandchild of <hi>Ham,</hi> the fourth diſcent from <hi>Noah.</hi> But he proceeds thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As this Patriarchal Power continued in</hi> Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50833:8"/> 
                  <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>even unto the Egyptian Bondage; ſo we finde it amongſt the Sons of</hi> Iſmael <hi>and</hi> Eſau: <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> Theſe are the Sons of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and theſe are their names by their Caſtles and Towns, Twelve Princes of their Tribes and Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 18. He owns this Paternal Government was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted during their Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe they were in ſubjection to a ſtronger Prince: <hi>But after the return of the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>out of bondage, God, out of a ſpecial care of them, choſe</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Joſuah <hi>ſucceſſively to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern as Princes, inſtead of the ſupream Fathers: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, God raiſed up Judges to defend his People. But when God gave them Kings, he re-eſtabliſhed the ancient and prime Right of Lineal-ſucceſſion to Paternal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And whenſoever he made choice of any ſpecial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be King, he intended that the Iſſue alſo ſhould have the benefit thereof, as being comprehended ſufficiently in the perſon of the Father, although the Father onely was named in the Grant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 19. The Author proceeds to obviate an Objection that he ſees may be made to his Hypotheſis, That it may ſeem abſurd that Kings now are Fathers of their People ſince Experience ſhews the contrary. <hi>It is true</hi> (ſays he) <hi>all Kings are not the natural Parents of their Subjects, yet they all either are, or are to be reputed the next Heirs to thoſe firſt Progenitors who were at firſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parents of the whole People; and ſo in their right ſucceed to the exerciſe of Supream Juriſdiction: and ſuch Heirs are not onely Lords of their own Children, but of their Brethren, and all others</hi> that were Subjects to <hi>their Fathers. And therefore we finde that God told</hi> Cain <hi>of his brother</hi> Abel, His deſires ſhall be toward thee, and thou ſhalt rule over him. <hi>Accordingly when</hi> Jacob <hi>bought his brothers Birthright,</hi> Iſaac <hi>bleſſed him thus:</hi> Be Lord over thy brethren, and let the ſons of thy mother bow before thee.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50833:8"/>
               <p>P. 20. <hi>As long as the firſt Fathers of Families lived, the name of Patriarch did aptly belong unto them; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few Deſcents, when the true Fatherhood it ſelf was extinct, and onely the right of the Father deſcended upon the true Heir, then the Title of Prince or King was more ſignificant to expreſs the power of him who ſucceeds onely to the right of Fatherhood which his Anceſtors did naturally enjoy. By this means it comes to paſs that many a Child, by ſucceeding a King, hath a right of a Father over many a gray-headed Multitude, and hath the Title of</hi> Pater Patriae.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be demanded, What becomes of the Right of Fatherhood, in caſe the Crown does eſcheat for want of an Heir; whether doth it not then devolve to the People? The Anſwer is, It is but the negligence or ignorance of the People to loſe the knowledge of the true Heir: for an Heir there is always. If</hi> Adam <hi>himſelf were ſtill living, and now ready to die, it is certain that there is one man, and but one in the world, who is next Heir, although the knowledge who ſhould be that one man, be quite loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 21. <hi>This ignorance of the People being admitted, it doth not by any means follow, that for want of Heirs the Supream Power is devolved to the Multitude, or that they have power to rule, and chuſe what Rulers they pleaſe. No, the Kingly power in ſuch caſes eſcheats to the Princes and independent Heads of Families: for every Kingdom is reſolved into thoſe parts whereof at firſt it was made. By the uniting of great Families or petty Kingdoms, we finde the greater Monarchies were at firſt erected; and into ſuch again, as into their firſt matter, many times they return again. And becauſe the dependancy of ancient Families is oft an obſure and worn-out knowledge, there the wiſdom of many Princes have thought fit to adopt thoſe for Heads of Families, and Princes of Provinces, whoſe Merits, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or Fortunes, have enabled them, or made them fit and capable of ſuch Royal Favours. All ſuch prime Heads
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50833:9"/> and Fathers have power to conſent in the uniting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of their Fatherly Right of Soveraign Authority on whom they pleaſe: And he that is ſo elected, claims not his power as a Donative from the People, but as being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God, from whom he receives his Royal Charter of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Father, though teſtified by the Miniſtry of the Heads of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 22. <hi>In all Kingdoms or Commonwealths in the world, whether the Prince be the Supreame Father of the People, or but the true Heir of ſuch a Father,</hi> p. 23. <hi>or whether he come to the Crown by uſurpation of the Nobles, or of the People, or by any other way whatſoever; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome few or a multitude govern the Commonwealth; yet ſtill the Authority that is in any one, or in many, or in all theſe, is the onely Right and natural Authority of a Supream Father. There is, and always ſhall be continued to the end of the world, a natural Right of a Supream Father over a multitude, although by the ſecret Will of God, many do at firſt moſt unjuſtly obtain the Exerciſe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To confirm this natural Right of Regal Power, we finde in the Decalogue, that the Law which enjoyns Obedience to Kings, is delivered in the Terms of,</hi> Honour thy Father and thy Mother: <hi>as if all Power were originally in the Father. If Obedience to Parents be due immediately by a natural Law and Subjection to Princes, but by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an humane Ordinance, what reaſon is there that the Laws of Nature ſhould give place to the Laws of Men? as we ſee the power of the Father over his Child, gives place, and is ſubordinate to the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 24. <hi>If we compare Rights of a Father with thoſe of a King, we finde them all one, without any difference at all, but onely in the latitude or extent of them: As the Father over one Family, ſo the King as Father over many Families, extends his care to preſerve, feed, clothe, inſtruct,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50833:9"/> and defend the whole Commonwealth. His War, his Peace, his Courts of Juſtice, and all his Acts of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tend onely to preſerve and diſtribute to every ſubordinate and inferiour Father, and to their Children their Rights and Priviledges; ſo that all the Duties of a King are ſummed up in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Fatherly Care of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been ſo juſt to the Author as to tranſcribe as much of his firſt Chapter as tends to prove the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power of Kings, as well that you might ſee the Hypotheſis which he builds his Divine Right of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchy in his own words, and ſo be the better able to judge whether I underſtand and anſwer him or not; as becauſe it contains the ſubſtance and ſtrength of all that the Author had to ſay in defence of it.</p>
               <p>So that I ſhall now fall to examine whether his Foundations will bear ſo weighty a Structure as he hath raiſed upon it. His firſt Argument againſt the natural Freedom of Mankinde is drawn from Scripture, and from <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s own Conceſſion, <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>was (and conſequently every other Father ought to be) a Prince over his Poſterity. And as</hi> Adam <hi>was Lord over his Children, ſo his Children, under him, had a power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their own Children, ſuberdinately to the firſt Parent, who was Lord Paramount over his Childrens Children to all Generations, as being the Grandfather of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that neither the Children of</hi> Adam <hi>or any elſe, can be free from ſubjection to their Parents; and this ſubjection to Parents being the foundation of all Legal Authority, by the Ordination of God himſelf: therefore no man can be born in a ſtate of Freedom or Equality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, I ſhall not concern my ſelf what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other have granted; but would be glad to know where and how God hath given this Abſolute power to Fathers over their Children, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50833:10"/> by what Law Children are tyed to an Abſolute Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Servitude to their Parents, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Preface to his Obſervations on</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle<hi>'s Politicks.</hi>
                  </note> ſince the Author in another place affirms, that at firſt a Childe, a Slave, and a Servant, were all one without any difference. I ſee no divine Charter in Scripture of any ſuch abſolute deſpotick power granted to <hi>Adam</hi> or any other Father.</p>
               <p>The Author, in his Obſervations on <hi>Grotius de Jure belli,</hi> &amp;c. founds this dominion of <hi>Adam</hi> over the Earth and all Creatures therein, on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. and quotes Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Mare Clauſum;</hi> where he ſays, <hi>That</hi> Adam, <hi>by donation from God, was made the general Lord of all things, not without ſuch a private dominion to himſelf as did exclude his Children,</hi> &amp;c. From which words I do not conceive that <hi>Adam</hi>'s abſolute power over his own Off-ſpring can be made out; for the words are ſpoken as well to the Female as Male of Mankind: <hi>Be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth, and have dominion over the fiſh of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and over every living thing that moveth</hi> (in the Original, <hi>creepeth) upon the face of the Earth.</hi> By which words <hi>Adam</hi> hath no power conferred upon him over his own Children (when he ſhould have them:) Theſe words implying no more than a conferring of a power by God on Mankind, under theſe words of <hi>Male and Female</hi> (and was not at all perſonal to <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi> alone) whereby they might ſubdue or tame the Brute Creatures for their uſe, not comprehending thoſe of the ſame kind with themſelves; ſince the general words extend no farther than to every living thing that <hi>creepeth</hi> upon the Earth: nor does Gods grant of the Creatures to <hi>Noah</hi> comprehend more than this: One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God there gives man a priviledge to kill the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for Food, which <hi>Adam</hi> had not. Which ſhews that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo far from having any ſuch power of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50833:10"/> Life and Death over his own Children, that he had it not ſo much as over Brute Creatures: Since if he had this power as a Monarch, it is highly probable, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father of all Men in the world, and having by the murder of <hi>Abel</hi> not onely loſt a Son but a Subject, it had been his Right alone to have puniſhed <hi>Cain</hi> the Murderer: Whereas we finde <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 14. upon his conviction of the Murder, telling God, that <hi>every one</hi> that findeth him, ſhould ſlay him; and therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 15. God ſet a mark upon <hi>Cain,</hi> leſt <hi>any</hi> finding him ſhould ſlay him. From whence we may infer, 1. That it was a Law of Nature then, that Murder was to be puniſhed. 2. That this Right of puniſhing did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Adam,</hi> as a Father, alone, ſo as to have power of Life and Death over his Children, ſince the Text does not mention that he was afraid his Father ſhould put him to death, but every one that met him: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does God ſet a mark upon him to ſecure him from <hi>Adam,</hi> but from any body elſe that ſhould light on him. From whence it follows, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had no more right by Gods conceſſion to take away his Sons life for the murder of his Brother, (which is one of the greateſt offences he could commit) than any other of his Brethren or Kinſmen; there is no reaſon why he ſhould have it in any other caſe. And as for what the Author ſays, <hi>That this Lordſhip which</hi> Adam <hi>had over the whole World, the Patriarchs by a Right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from him, did enjoy; which was as large and ample as the abſoluteſt Dominion of any Monarch which hath been ſince the Creation;</hi> I cannot underſtand how this Right derives it ſelf from <hi>Adam:</hi> For he tells us but a little before, <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>That Civil Power not onely in general is by divine Inſtitution, but even the Aſſignment of it ſpecifically to the eldeſt Parents.</hi> Therefore granting that all the Patriarchs from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s twelve Sons, incluſively, aſſumed a power of Life and Death
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50833:11"/> over their own Families, 1. I deſire to know how this Right can be derived from <hi>Adam:</hi> for the Right of ſupream Monarch of the world deſcending upon the eldeſt Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom we will ſuppoſe to have been <hi>Seth</hi> (ſince <hi>Cain</hi> might forfeit his Birthright,) this power of Life and Death could onely be truly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the eldeſt Grandchild, or deſcendant from <hi>Seth;</hi> which I ſuppoſe the Author means by <hi>eldeſt Parents,</hi> or elſe he talks nonſence: And that <hi>Abraham</hi> was this eldeſt Grand-ſon of <hi>Seth,</hi> will be hard to prove, ſince it is not apparent from Scripture, whether <hi>Shem</hi> or <hi>Japhet</hi> were the eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Abram</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Terah.</hi> And the Fathers and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Commentators on this place, are divided in their opinions concerning this point. And it is plain from divers places in Scripture, that the eldeſt Son is not always firſt named. But ſuppoſing that <hi>Shem</hi> was the eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> it does not appear that <hi>Arphaxad</hi> from whom <hi>Abram</hi> deſcended, was his eldeſt Son, ſince the Scripture does not undertake to give us the names of all the Sons of <hi>Shem,</hi> but onely of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> as his name was neceſſary for the deriving of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Anceſtor of the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if any man will anſwer (as the Author does, <hi>p.</hi> 21.) that this right Heir of <hi>Adam</hi> coming by length of time to be loſt, this ſupream Kingly power became devolved to all independent Heads of Families; then this Right of <hi>Adam,</hi> as Lord and King of the whole World, as the firſt man, muſt certainly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, ſince none but the true Heir could have a Right to that (according to the Author's principles:) So that this power of Life and Death which the Author will have the Patriarchs to have exerciſed over thoſe of their Family, muſt belong to them either as Fathers, or elſe as Maſters, or Heads of their particular Families; and not as Heirs to <hi>Adam.</hi> But ſince the Author ſeems
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50833:11"/> to found this Power of <hi>Adam</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Hunton</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, (See <hi>Anarchy of a limited Monarchy,</hi> p. 264.) That it is God's Ordinance that there ſhould be Civil Government, becauſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. God ordained <hi>Adam</hi>

                  </note> who are always ſuppoſed to be in the ſtate of Nature, in reſpect to each other. Yet though I will not deny, but ſome Gratitude and Acknwledgment is due from Children to Parents, even for this, that they did enter into the ſtate of Marriage for their generation, and were the occaſion of their Being: Yet I do not ſee, how by this alone a Father acquires an abſolute power and dominion over the perſon of the Child, to diſpoſe of it as he thinks fit: Since Parents acting here only as Natural, and not Moral Agents, they are not the voluntary Cauſes of its generation: Therefore I cannot found ſo great a Right as that of an abſolute perpetual Dominion over the Children, upon ſo ſlight a foundation.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore trace this Right of Fathers over his Children to a more true original than any of theſe. Since then all the Laws of Nature, or Reaſon, are intended for one end or effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the common good and preſervation of Mankinde; and that Marriage is no otherwiſe a Duty, than as by the propagation of our Species it conduces to, without the help and aſſiſtance of others; and that the Parents entred into this ſtate of Marriage for the procreation of Children: both the Inſtinct of Nature and Law of Reaſon dictate, that they are obliged to take care of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50833:13"/> and provide for that Child, which they as ſubordinate Cauſes have <hi>produced;</hi> as being thoſe on whom God hath impoſed this Duty, which is much greater than that of Generation: for now the world is ſufficiently peopled, it may be doubted, whether any perſon is obliged to Marry, further than it may conſiſt with their conveniency, or courſe of Life. But Parents, when they are Married, are tyed by the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to take care of the Children. Therefore I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the higheſt Right of Parents in their Children, doth ariſe merely from their diſcharge of this great Duty of Education, as may appear from this Inſtance. Suppoſe the Parents not being willing to undertake the trouble of breeding up the Child, do either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, or paſs over their Right in it to another, aſſoon as it is born; I deſire to know if the perſon that finds this Child, or he to whom it is aſſigned, breed it up until it come to have the uſe of Reaſon, what Duty this Child can owe his Parents, if they are made known to him? Certainly, all the obligation he can have to them, muſt be upon the ſcore of their begetting him; which how ſmall that is, you may obſerve from what hath been ſaid before: nor can the Parents claim any further Right in this Child, ſince by their expoſing and granting it away, they renounced all the Intereſt they could have in it; ſo that the Duty and Gratitude he ſhould have owed them, had they taken upon them the care and trouble of breeding him up, is now due to his Foſter-Father or Mother, who took care of him until he was able to ſhift for himſelf. From whence it is evident, that the higheſt Right which Parents can have in their Children, is not meerly natural, from generation; but acquir'd by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that nobler part of their Duty. And ſo the higheſt Obedience which Children owe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, proceeds from that Gratitude and Senſe they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50833:13"/> ought to have of the great obligation they owe their Parents, for the trouble and care they put them to in their Education.</p>
               <p>Having now, I hope, found out the Original of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Right and Intereſt in their Children, and the chief ground of their Gratitude and Duty to their Parents; we will now proceed to the Second Point propoſed, and conſider what kinde of Right this is, and how far it extends. Since therefore the Father's greateſt intereſt in his Child proceeds from his having bred it up, and taken care of it, and that this Duty is founded on that great Law of Nature, that every Man ought to endeavour the common good of Mankinde, which he performs, as far as lies in his power, in bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up, and taking care of his Child; it follows, that this right in the Child, or power over it, extends no farther than as it conduces to this end, that is, the good and preſervation thereof: and when this Rule is tranſgreſſed, the Right ceaſes. For God hath not delivered one man into the power of another, merely to be tyrannized over at his pleaſure; but that the perſon who hath this Authority, may uſe it for the good of thoſe he governs. And herein lies the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Intereſt which a Father hath in his Children, and that property which he hath in his Horſes or Slaves; ſince his right to the former extends only to thoſe things that conduce to their Good and Benefit; but in the other he hath no other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but the profit he may reap from their labour and ſervice, being under no other obligation but that of Humanity, and of uſing them as becomes a good-natur'd and merciful man; yet ſtill conſidering and intending his own advantage, as the principal end of his keeping of them. Whereas in his Children he is chiefly to deſign their good and advantage, as far as lies in his power, without ruining himſelf: and though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50833:14"/> he juſtly may make uſe of their labour and ſervice while they continue as part of his Family; yet it is not for the ſame end alone that he uſes his Horſes or Slaves, but that his Children being bred up in a conſtant courſe of Induſtry, may be the better able either to get their own living, or elſe to ſpend their time as they ought to do, without falling into the Vices of Idleneſs or Debauchery. So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Father has no more right over the Life of his Child than another man; being as much anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God if he abuſe this Right of a Father, in killing his innocent Son, as if another had done it. Neither hath he from the ſame Principles any right to maim or caſtrate his Child, (as this Author allows him to do, in his Directions for Obedience;) much leſs ſell him for a Slave: Therefore it is no part of the Law of Nature, (unleſs he cannot otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for it) but of the <hi>Roman,</hi> or Civil-Law, that a Father ſhould have power to ſell his Son three times. For the Father is appointed by God to meliorate the condition of his Child, but not to make it worſe; ſince it is not himſelf, but God that properly gave him his being. So that I hope I have ſufficiently proved there is a great difference between a Child and a Slave, or a Servant for Life, though this Authour will have them in the ſtate of Nature to be all one.</p>
               <p>But, for the better clearing of this point, how far the power of Parents over their Children extends, I think we may very well divide (as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> does) the life of the Child into three periods or ages. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De J.B.</hi> l. 2. c. 5. § 2.</note> The firſt is the time of imperfect judgment, or before the Child comes to be able to exerciſe his Reaſon. The ſecond is the period of perfect Judgment, yet whilſt the Child ſtill continues part of his Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The third is after he hath left his Father's,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50833:14"/> and either enters into another Family, or ſets up a Family himſelf. In the firſt Period, all the actions of Children are under the abſolute dominion of their Parents: for ſince they have not the uſe of Reaſon, nor are able to judge what is good or bad for themſelves, they could not grow up nor be preſerved, unleſs their Parents judged for them what means conduced to this end; yet this power is ſtill to be directed for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end, the good and preſervation of the Child. In the ſecond Period, when they are of mature Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet continue part of their Fathers Family, they are ſtill under their Fathers command, and ought to be obedient to it in all actions which tend to the good of their Fathers Family and concerns; and in both theſe Ages the Father hath a power to ſet his Children to work, as well to enable them to get their own Living, as to recompence himſelf for the pains and care he hath taken, and the charge he may have bin at in their Education. For though he were obliged by the Law of Nature to breed up his Children, yet there is no reaſon but he may make uſe of their labour, as a natural recompence for his trouble. And in this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod the Father hath power to correct his Son, if he prove negligent, or diſobedient; ſince this Correction is for his advantage, to make him more careful and diligent another time, and to ſubdue the ſtubbornneſs of his Will: But in other actions the Children have a power of acting freely, yet ſtill with reſpect of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and pleaſing their Parents, to whom they are obliged for their Being and Education, ſince without their care they could not have attained to that age. But ſince this Duty is not by force of any abſolute Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only of Piety, Gratitude and Obſervance, it does not make void any act, though done contrary to thoſe Duties, as Marriage, and the like; for the gift of a thing is not therefore void, though made contrary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50833:15"/> to the Rule of Prudence and Frugality. In the third Period, they are in all actions free, and at their own diſpoſe; yet ſtill under thoſe obligations of Gratitude, Piety and Obſervance toward their Parents as their greateſt Benefactors, ſince if that they have well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their Duty toward their Children, they can never in their whole lives ſufficiently recompence ſo great benefits as they have received from them.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems the Authour is not ſatisfied with theſe diſtinctions, <note place="margin">Obſervations on <hi>Grotius</hi> de J. B. <hi>p.</hi> 62.</note> but ſaies, <hi>He cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how in any caſe Children can ever naturally have any power or moral Faculty of doing what they pleaſe, without their Parents leave; ſince they are always bound to ſtudy to pleaſe them. And though by the Laws of ſome Nations, Children when they attain to years of diſcretion, have Power and Liberty in many actions, yet this Liberty is granted them by poſitive humane Laws only, which are made by the Supreme Fatherly Power of Princes, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate, limit, or aſſume the Authority of Inferiour Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the publick benefit of the Commonwealth: So that naturally the Power of Parents over their Children never ceaſeth by any ſeparation, but only by the permiſſion of the tranſcendent Fatherly Power of the Supreme Prince, Children may be diſpenſed with, or priviledged in ſome caſes from obedience to ſubordinate Parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part, I ſee no reaſon why theſe diſtinctions of <hi>Grotius</hi> may not be well enough defended againſt all the Reaſons which the Authour gives us to the contrary: For he only tells us, <hi>He cannot conceive how in any caſe Children can ever naturally have any power or moral faculty of doing what they pleaſe, without their Fathers leave; and that naturally the Power of Parents never ceaſeth by any ſeparation,</hi> &amp;c. but gives us no other reaſon, than that they are always bound to ſtudy to pleaſe them. As if this obligation of Gratitude and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50833:15"/> Complacency, did likewiſe comprehend a full and perfect propriety of all Fathers in the perſons of their Children, and an abſolute power over them in all caſes whatſoever, ſo that Children ſhall have no Right left to conſult their own good or preſervation, in any caſe whatſoever, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Bodin</hi> de Rep. l. 1. c. 4.</note> farther than the Father pleaſes. As for <hi>Bodin,</hi> and divers others that have writ on this ſubject, they do no more than follow others, who have aſſerted this Abſolute Power, upon no other grounds than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Municipal Laws; but have never troubled themſelves to look into the true Original of Paternal Authority, or Filial Subjection, according to the Laws of Nature or Reaſon. And moſt Treatiſes of this ſubject being commonly written by Fathers, they have been very full in ſetting forth their own Power and Authority over their Children; but have ſaid little or nothing of the Rights of Children, in the ſtate of Nature, towards their Parents. <note place="margin">Loc. ſup. laudat.</note> Therefore <hi>Bodin</hi> thinks he hath done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in ſuppoſing that if a Father is wiſe, and not mad, he will never kill his Son without cauſe, ſince he will never correct him without he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; and that therefore the Civil Law ſuppoſes, that the Will of the Parents in managing the concerns of their Children, is void of all Fraud; and that they will rather violate all Divine and Humane Laws, than not endeavour to make their Children both rich and honourable: And from thoſe inſtances out of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Law, ſuppoſes that Parents cannot ſo much as will any thing to their Childrens prejudice, or ſo much as abuſe this Fatherly Power of Life and Death: And therefore thinks he hath ſufficiently anſwered the Objection he makes, that there have been ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who have abuſed this power ſo far, as to put their Children to Death without cauſe. He ſays,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50833:16"/> They give us no Examples to the contrary: And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this to have ſometimes fallen out, muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Legiſlators alter a wholſome Law, becauſe ſome perſons may abuſe it?</p>
               <p>But if we conſider what <hi>Bodin</hi> hath here ſaid, we ſhall finde every one of his Suppoſitions falſe: For, 1. he ſuppoſes it to be the Right of all Fathers, by the Law of Nature, to have an abſolute power over the lives and perſons of their Children. 2. That the Jewiſh and Roman Law are moſt agreeable to the Laws of Nature in this point. 3. That Fathers do ſeldom or never abuſe this power. 4. That if they do abuſe it, yet it is better to leave it in their hands, than to abrogate it or retrench it. The falſeneſs of all which Aſſertions, I either have already, or elſe ſhall hereafter make manifeſt: Only I ſhall remark thus much at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, That upon <hi>Bodin</hi>'s principle, women that murder their Baſtards would have a good time on't, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Husbands, they have full power over the Life of their Children; and there is no reaſon that it ſhould be retrencht by any poſitive Laws, becauſe ſome offend againſt it. But however, this Argument of <hi>Bodin</hi>'s would do our Author's cauſe no good: for if Parents are to be truſted with this abſolute power over their Children, becauſe of the natural affection they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppoſed to bear them; then Princes ought not to be truſted with it, ſince none but Parents themſelves can have this natural affection towards their Children; Princes (as the Author grants) having this power onely as repreſenting theſe Parents. Whereas Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is a natural Relation, and neither can be created nor aſſigned farther than the Civil Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have appointed; and therefore there can be no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Son by the Law of Nature, ſince Adoption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes chiefly from the promiſe and conſent of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon adopted, and partly from the Authority of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50833:16"/> Civil Law, or Municipal Law of the Commonwealth. So that in relation to Princes, upon this Reaſon of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi>'s, <hi>ceſſante cauſa, ceſſat effectus.</hi> But indeed <hi>Bodin</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreamt of this fine Notion of our Author's, that all Monarchs were not onely Heads, but Fathers of their people, or elſe certainly we ſhould have had this as the chief Argument to prove his French Monarchy to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> But I ſhall trouble my ſelf no farther with him at preſent, but ſhall proceed to conſider this point of abſolute Obedience a little farther.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe the Author (as any ſober man elſe) would grant, that Children are not obliged ſo much as to attempt to perform the commands of their Parents, in caſe they evidently appear impoſſible or extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, ſuch as a Father may give when he is in a fit of drunkenneſs, madneſs, or ſudden rage, which is all one with madneſs; and of this who can judge, but the Children who are to perform theſe Commands? And in this caſe no man will deny but it is lawful for the Children to hold, nay binde their mad or drunken Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in caſe they cannot otherwiſe hinder them from doing miſchief, or killing either themſelves, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Brethren. So that though they may do this from that natural love &amp; charity which all men in the ſtate of nature ought to ſhew toward each other, yet they may likewiſe juſtifie the doing of it as Children, who ought to have a greater concern for the good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Parents, than meer ſtrangers, and have therefore an higher obligation to prevent their doing any miſchief either to themſelves or neer Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; this being for the Fathers good and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that for which he hath cauſe to thank them when he comes to himſelf. And if it be ſaid, that the Son may then refuſe his Fathers Commands, or reſiſt them, pretending he is mad, drunk, or in a rage, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is not, and thereby take occaſion to obey his Father
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50833:17"/> no farther than he pleaſes: to this I anſwer, That the Son is either really perſwaded that his Father is in ſome of thoſe evil circumſtances before mentioned, or elſe onely pretends that he thinks ſo, when really he does not. If in the firſt caſe he erre in his judgment, and the ignorance did not proceed from his own fault (either of paſſion, prejudice, or too ſlight an eſteem of his Fathers underſtanding) he is not culpable, though he make ſuch a falſe judgment of his Fathers actions: for God conſidering onely the ſincerity of the heart, does not require of any man more than he is able to perform. But if on the other ſide the Son play the Hypocrite, and refuſe his Parents Commands, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are mad or drunk, when really they are not, he is without doubt doubly guilty both, of Hypocriſie and Diſobedience. But this does not hinder Children in the ſtate of Nature from judging of the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or lawfulneſs of their Parents Commands, and of the condition they are in when they gave them: for otherwiſe a Child ought to be of his Fathers Religion, though it were Idolatry, if he commanded it; or were obliged to break any of the Laws of Nature, if this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience were abſolute. And it is a leſſer evil that the Commands of Parents ſhould be diſobeyed, nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their perſons reſiſted, than that they ſhould make a Right to command or do unreaſonable and unlawful things in a fit of madneſs, drunkenneſs, or paſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy either themſelves or others.</p>
               <p>But it may be replied, that though Fathers in the ſtate of Nature have no Right to act unjuſtly or cruelly toward their Children, or to command ſuch unlawful or unreaſonable things; yet however they are onely anſwerable to God for ſo doing; and there is out of a Commonwealth no ſuperiour power that can queſtion the Fathers actions: for ſince his Children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God to his care, he onely is anſwerable for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50833:17"/> them, and for his actions towards them, ſince no other man hath any intereſt or concern in them but himſelf. So that if he kill, maim, abuſe, or ſell his Son, there is no man that hath Right to revenge, puniſh, or call him to an account for ſo doing; and if no others that are his equals, much leſs his Wife and Children, who are ſo much his Inferiours, and who ought in all things to be obedient to his Will. Therefore this Power, though it be not abſolute in reſpect of God, yet is ſo in reſpect of his Wife and Children: and ſo in all caſes where the Children cannot yield an active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Fathers commands, they are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding obliged (by the Law of God; See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.20.) to a paſſive one; and patiently to ſubmit to whatever evils or puniſhments he pleaſes to inflict, though it were to the loſs of Life itſelf.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, That though it is true, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſtate of Nature, and conſidered as the head of a ſeparate Family, hath no Superiour but God, and conſequently no other perſon whatſoever hath any Authority or Right to call him to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and puniſh him for this abuſe of his paternal Power; yet it doth not follow, that ſuch abſolute ſubmiſſion is therefore due from the Children, as does oblige them either to an active or a paſſive Obedience in all caſes to the Fathers Will, ſo that they neither may, nor ought to defend themſelves in any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whatſoever. There is a great deal of difference (in the ſtate of Nature) between calling a man to an account as a Superiour, and defending a mans ſelf as an equal. For a man in this ſtate hath a right to this latter againſt all men that aſſault him, by the principle of Self-preſervation: But no man hath a right to the former, but onely in reſpect of thoſe over whom he hath an Authority, either granted him by God, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him by the conſent of other men. So
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50833:18"/> that the evils which an Aggreſſor, or Wrong-doer, ſuffers from him he injured, though in reſpect of God the Supreme Lawgiver they may be natural Puniſhments ordained by him, to deter men from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Laws of Nature, yet they are not ſo in regard of the Perſon who inflicts them. For God may ſometimes appoint thoſe for the Inſtruments of his Juſtice, who otherwiſe do injury to the perſon puniſhed; as in the caſe of <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Rebellion againſt his Father <hi>David.</hi> So that in this caſe the evils the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer ſuffers are not properly Puniſhments, but neceſſary Conſequences of his Violence and Injuſtice; and in reſpect of the Inflicter, are but neceſſary means of his preſervation. So that if a Son have any Right to defend himſelf in what belongs to him from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt violence of his Father, he doth not act as his Superiour; but in this caſe as his Equal, as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all the Rights of Nature, conſidered only as a Man; Such as are a Right to live, and to preſerve himſelf, and to uſe all lawful means for that end. Therefore ſince, as I have already ſhown, that a Father hath no higher Right or Authority from God over the perſon of his Child, but as it tends to his good and preſervation, or as it conduces to the great end of Nature, the common Good and preſervation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: So when the Father tranſgreſſes this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, his Right ceaſes; and when that ceaſes, the Sons Right to preſerve himſelf (and in that, to purſue that great end) begins to take place. Therefore out of a Civil ſtate, if a Father will endeavour evidently, without any juſt cauſe, to take away his Sons Life, I think the Son may in this caſe, if he cannot otherwiſe eſcape nor avoid it, and that his Father will not be pacified nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his ſubmiſſion nor entreaty, defend himſelf againſt his Father, not with a deſign to kill him, but purely to preſerve his own Life; and if in this caſe the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50833:18"/> Father happen to be kill'd, I think his Blood is upon his own head. But if any object to me the Example of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s ſubmiſſion to his Father, when he intended to ſacriſice him: To this I anſwer, that as this act of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s is not to be taken as an Example for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers, ſo neither does the Example of <hi>Iſaac</hi> oblige other Sons. For as <hi>Abraham</hi> had no right to offer up his Son, but by God's expreſs Will; ſo it is rational to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> being then (as Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers make him) about nineteen or twenty years of Age, and able to carry wood enough upon his back to conſume the Sacrifice, and of years to ask where the Lamb was for the Offering; was alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his Father of the cauſe of his dealing ſo with him: and then the ſubmiſſion was not paid to his Father's, but to God's Will, whom he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded would have it ſo. But if any man yet doubts, whether reſiſtance in ſuch a caſe were lawful, I leave it to his own Conſcience, whether if his Father and he were out of any civil eſtate, whoſe aſſiſtance he might implore, he would lie ſtill, and ſuffer his Father to cut his throat, only becauſe he had a minde to it, or pretended revelation for it.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe if a Father in this ſtate ſhould go about to violate his Sons Wife in his preſence, or to kill her, or his Grandchildren, I ſuppoſe he may as lawfully uſe the ſame means for their preſervation, (if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe obtain it) as he might for his own; ſince they are delivered to his charge, and that he only is anſwerable for them. For ſince the Father doth not acquire any property in the Sons perſon, either by begetting or educating him, much leſs ought he to have it over thoſe the Son hath begotten.</p>
               <p>But though Children may have this Right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their own Lives, or thoſe of their Wives and Children, from their Fathers unjuſt violence, when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50833:19"/> they can by no means elſe be preſerved; Yet I would not be here underſtood to give Children this right of reſiſting upon any leſs occaſion; as if the Father ſhould only go about to correct his Son, though without juſt cauſe, it were therefore lawful for him to reſiſt or beat his Father. For we are obliged by the Law of Chriſt to bear ſmaller Injuries from others, much more from a Father; neither yet would I give them any right to continue this ſtate of War, and to revenge upon their Parents the Injuries they have formerly received at their hands. For all Revenge, taken in this ſence, as a ſatisfaction of the minde in returning of an evil or injury already received, without any reſpect to a mans own preſervation, or the good of the perſon that did the wrong, is unlawful even in the ſtate of Nature. Therefore this returning Evil for Evil, which ſome improperly call Revenge, is only juſtifiable for one or both of theſe ends; either to make the party that hath done the Injury ſenſible of his Errour, and ſeeing the Follies and Inconveniences of it, to alter his minde, and reſolve to do ſo no more; or as it may conduce to a mans own preſervation for the future, and be a warning to others not to injure him in like manner, ſince they ſee he will not take injuries tamely. But all this is ſtill left to a mans own prudence, how far he will paſs them by: And he is certainly obliged to leave off returning them, aſſoon as he can be ſafe without it; ſince otherwiſe quarrels would be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Neither ought one, who hath been highly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to a man perhaps for his life, to return him evil for evil, ſince ſcarce any Injury being great enough to cancel ſo great an Obligation. Therefore ſince a Father, who hath truely performed his Duty, is the greateſt Benefactor we can imagine in this life; ſo no man ought to revenge an Injury, though never ſo great, upon him; ſince it is not only undutiful, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50833:19"/> ungrateful, and cannot ſerve either of thoſe two ends for which alone this returning evil for evil is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For firſt, it cannot make the Father ſee his fault; ſince this correction being from a Son whom he looks upon as one highly obliged to him, and ſo much his inferior, will rather ſerve to exaſperate than amend him. Secondly, Neither can this bearing of the Injury encourage others to attempt doing the like; ſince all that know the caſe, will likewiſe conſider the perſon that did the wrong. So that Patience alone is the only lawful means to make the Father ſee his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and be reconciled to his Child, who ought to embrace it aſſoon as the Father offers it.</p>
               <p>But as for the places of Scripture brought for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Obedience to Parents; <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, obey your Parents in the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 6.1,2. and <hi>Children, obey your Parents in all things,</hi> Col. 3.20. God did not intend here to give us any new Law or Precept concerning this Duty, but to confirm and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the fifth Commandment; as that was but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Law of Nature, by which men were obliged to reverence and obey their Parents, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Law was given. Therefore ſince the Laws of Nature (which are but Rules of right Reaſon for the good of Mankinde) are the foundation of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and of all thoſe commands in the New Teſtament, they are ſtill to be interpreted according to that Rule. Neither are other places of Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in any other ſence; ſuch as are thoſe of turning the right Cheek, of giving away a mans Coat to him that would go to Law, and the like: all which we are not to Interpret Literally, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Grotius <hi>and. Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's <hi>Annot. upon theſe places.</hi>
                  </note> but according to Reaſon. And ſo are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe theſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Children, obey your Parents in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50833:20"/> all things;</hi> that is, in all things reaſonable and lawful. And this ſence muſt be allowed of, or elſe Children were bound to obey all commands of their Parents, whether unlawful or lawful; being comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this general word <hi>All.</hi> Nor will the diſtinction of an active or paſſive Obedience help in this caſe; for paſſive Obedience cannot be the end of the Fathers command, and conſequently his will is not performed in ſuffering; ſince no Father can be ſo unreaſonably cruel, as to command a thing meerly becauſe he would have occaſion to puniſh his Son whom he thinks muſt not reſiſt him. Neither do theſe places appoint a Son when an infant, a man of full age, and perhaps an old man of threeſcore, to be all governed the ſame way, or that the ſame Obedience is required of them all.</p>
               <p>And this brings me to a fuller Anſwer to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Argument, and to ſhew that though Children are indeed always bound in Gratitude to pleaſe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (as far as they are able without ruining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) and to pay a great reverence to them; yet that this ſubmiſſion is not an abſolute ſubjection, but is to be limited according to the Rules of right Reaſon or Prudence. And to prove this, I will produce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from the caſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children, ſince the Author allows no Father to have had a larger autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than himſelf: We will therefore conſider in the firſt place, <hi>Adam</hi>'s power as a Father, in reſpect of his Sons marriage. Suppoſe then that he had commanded one of his Sons never to marry at all, certainly this command would have been yoid, ſince then it had been in <hi>Adam</hi>'s power to have fruſtrated Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to mankind of increaſe and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the Earth; which was not ſpoken to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> alone, ſince they could not do it in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but to all mankind repreſented in them. And likewiſe <hi>Adam</hi> had been the occaſion of his Sons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50833:20"/> if he had lain with any of his Siſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abel</hi> to marry one of his Siſters (that being the onely means then appointed to propagate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) which he could not love, can any man think that he had been obliged to do it? Certainly no: for it would have been a greater ſin to marry a wife he knew before-hand he could not live with, than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey his Father; for elſe how could this be true, <hi>Therefore ſhall a man leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife?</hi> Since then <hi>Adam</hi> could not force his Sons affections, but onely recommend ſuch of his Siſters as he thought would beſt ſuit with his humour, therefore if the Son could not live without marriage, and that <hi>Adam</hi> could not force a Wife upon him, it was moſt reaſonable that he ſhould chuſe a Wife for himſelf. And to come to that other great point, that the Son can never ſeparate himſelf from his Fathers Family nor ſubjection, as his Lord and Maſter, without his conſent: Suppoſe then that <hi>Adam</hi> had been ſo cruel and unnatural (as ſome Fathers are) and being ſenſible of the profit he received from his Sons labours, would never have given them leave to have left his Family, and have ſet up for themſelves, nor to have had any thing of their own, but (onely allowing them and their Wives a bare ſubſiſtance) have kept them like ſlaves as long as they lived; the Author I ſuppoſe would reply, That he might have done ſo if he had pleaſed; and that the Sons had no lawful means to help themſelves, ſince he onely was Judge when or whether ever it was fit to ſet them free or no.</p>
               <p>But I deſire to know whether <hi>Adam</hi> had this power by a natural Right, or an acquired; not by the latter: for I have already proved, that neither Generation nor Poſſeſſion can confer an abſolute Right over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50833:21"/> of another: Nor yet could he have it by the Sons conſent; for they would never give their conſent to ſuch an abſolute ſlaviſh ſubjection. Nor yet could he have any ſuch Right by the revealed Will of God, ſince I have alſo proved that ſuch an abſolute ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nowhere requir'd by him in Scripture.</p>
               <p>But now to return to the acquired Right of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither can that confer ſo abſolute a power over any mans perſon, as that therefore he ſhould be a ſlave to his Foſterer as long as he liv'd; ſince admitting that the Father, or other perſon that takes upon him that care, may perhaps juſtly claim a Right in the ſervice or labour of the Childe, to ſatisfie them for their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charge in bringing him up: Yet it does not therefore follow, that this ſervice is due as long as the Childe lives, but rather until ſuch time as they can make his labour ſatisfie them for their charge and trouble in keeping him; which may very well be by that time the Child attains to twenty five years of age at fartheſt. And there are thoſe that have offered to breed up and maintain all the Foundlings and Baſtard-children in <hi>England,</hi> if they may be bound to ſerve them until about that age. So that I ſee no reaſon why a few years Education ſhould give any man a Right over another perſon as long as he lived. But if it be urged that the Childe owed his life to his Father or Foſterer, ſince without his aſſiſtance he muſt have periſht, and therefore the ſervice of the Childs whole life is but little enough to recompence it; to this I anſwer, That the Parents are under an abſolute obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, by the Laws of God and Nature, to breed up their Childe; and they ſin if they do not perform it as they ought: the end of a Father not being chiefly for the breeding up and preſervation of the Child, and therefore there is no reaſon he ſhould acquire ſuch a property in him, meerly becauſe he did his duty; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50833:21"/> the intent of a Father being to better the condition of his Son, and not to make it worſe, I doubt whether an abſolute or perpetual Servitude, or Death it ſelf, were the better bargain; and if this Right will not hold for the Father himſelf, much leſs will it for a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterer, ſince he is likewiſe obliged by the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Humanity, if he be able, to breed up the Child he finds, and not to let it periſh. So that the advantage he may make of the Child ought not to be the principal end of his undertaking, but the doing of good to mankind; and the advantage is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered onely as an encouragement, not as the onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his duty, ſince he is obliged to do the ſame thing, though he were ſure the Childe would either die or be taken away from him, before it could be with him half long enough to ſatisfie him. Neither does this reaſon hold true, according to the Scripture-rules of Gratitude, that a man hath Right to exact of one to whom he hath done a Courteſie, or beſtowed a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, a Return as great as the Benefit beſtowed; ſince this were not beneficence, but meer bartering or exchange: And a man who had his life ſaved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſiſtance (ſuppoſe by pulling him out of the water) was obliged by this principle to leave his life at his diſpoſal ever after.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſee no reaſon, from all that hath yet been ſaid, why a Son when he comes to be a man able to ſhift for himſelf, may not in the ſtate of nature marry, and ſeparate himſelf from his fathers Family, even without his Fathers conſent, if he cannot otherwiſe obtain his liberty by his entreaty and all fair means: Not but that the Father may, if he pleaſe, diſinherit his Son for ſo doing, or for marrying without his conſent, ſince every man is free to diſpoſe of his own upon what conditions he thinks fit. And the Son was to have conſidered before-hand which he valued moſt, his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50833:22"/> own Liberty, or his Fathers kindneſs, and the hopes of his ſhare of his Eſtate after his death.</p>
               <p>But I now come to the Author's main Argument from Scripture-Examples: <hi>That the Patriarchs, by a Right derived from</hi> Adam, <hi>did exerciſe as Heads of their reſpective Families, a dominion as abſolute as that of any Monarch: And ſo inſtances in</hi> Thamar <hi>brought out to be burnt by her Father-in-law</hi> Judah: <hi>Touching War,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram<hi>'s commanding an Army of</hi> 318 <hi>Souldiers of his own Family;</hi> Eſau<hi>'s meeting his Brother with</hi> 400 <hi>men at Arms: For matter of Peace,</hi> Abram<hi>'s making a League with</hi> Abimelech: <hi>And that theſe acts of judging in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Crimes, of making War and Peace, are the chiefeſt marks of Soveraignty that are found in a Monarchy.</hi> All which I ſhall endeavour to anſwer. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The inſtance of <hi>Judah</hi> rather makes againſt him; for he confines this power before to the chief Father of the Family, and will never have Children to be free from ſubjection to their Fathers: whereas in this caſe <hi>Judah,</hi> as Head of his own Family, exerciſed an abſolute power of Life and Death, and ſo was free from ſubjection to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was then living. And ſuppoſe (as the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. expreſſes) <hi>Judah</hi> went down from his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to a certain <hi>Adullamite,</hi> and there married, and ſet up a diſtinct Family; yet this will not help the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſince (<hi>p.</hi> 33.) he will not allow the Fatherly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be confined to one Family, if the Families were at ſuch a diſtance as they might receive their fathers commands; which lies upon him to prove: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſubjection was not perpetual. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew by another Example, that the Head of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily hath not abſolute power of the lives of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Grandchildren; and that is from <hi>Reuben</hi>'s pathetical Speech, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he refuſed to ſend <hi>Benjamin</hi> with him into <hi>Egypt; Slay my two ſons</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if I bring him not unto thee.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50833:22"/> Now if <hi>Jacob</hi> had this abſolute power as a Father, it had been impertinent in <hi>Reuben</hi> to have ſpoke thus, ſince he knew his Father had power to ſlay his Sons, if he thought fit, whether he gave him ſuch an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or not. But if it be replied, that <hi>Jacob</hi> when his Sons married might ſet them at liberty, and ſo give them power of Life and Death; that is, make them abſolute in their reſpective Families: This is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and no proof brought of it out of Scripture, and therefore may as well be otherwiſe: Nor is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould thus manumit his Sons, ſince it is apparent they did not then ſet up diſtinct Families; for we finde <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtill commanding them, as Head of the Family, to go down and buy Corn in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Go down and buy us</hi> (that is, the whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereof they were Members) <hi>a little food.</hi> And yet theſe Sons did not think their Fathers command ſo abſolute, but that they tell him plainly, they will not go down unleſs he ſend <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>As for the other Examples of <hi>Abram</hi>'s exerciſing the full power of a Prince in making War and Peace, I will not deny that the Heads of ſeparate Families, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Commonwealths, have many things analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to them, though they are not Commonwealths themſelves: And the reaſon why I do not allow them to be ſo, is, becauſe the ends of a Family and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth are divers: and ſo many parts of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Empire are not to be found in Families, yet the Heads of ſuch Families may notwithſtanding exerciſe a power of Life and Death in great Offences, and alſo of making War and Peace: And this being for the good of the Family they govern, and by their implyed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, no body will contradict him in the exerciſe of this power. But this being matter of fact, does not prove an abſolute and unqueſtionable Right in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſuch a Family, of doing whatſoever he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50833:23"/> pleaſe, and that no Member of the Family hath power in any caſe to contradict his will; for it is rational to conceive that this Father of a Family having had an authority over his Children and Servants (born per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in his houſe) from their very Infancy, and if he be a wiſe and a good man, and hath carried himſelf as a good Father or Maſter ought to do toward them, ſhould even by their conſents (as knowing none more worthy than himſelf) retain the exerciſe of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority after they are gown up to be men; in which he cannot be contradicted, without diſorder and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the whole Family: So that indeed this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Children and Servants, is by a tacite conſent to obey the Father or Maſter in all things ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common good of the Family. But this proves not this abſolute deſpotick power the Author contends for, but onely the moſt reaſonable way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting for the Families good, and whilſt the Father exerciſes this Authority onely for that end, which when he tranſgreſſes, his Right to govern ceaſes: for if this Author would have but conſidered the ſtate of ſome parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> he ſhould have found, that where the Father will exerciſe this abſolute power, and ſell his Children for ſlaves, the Children make as little ſcruple (where they are ſtrong enough) to put the ſame trick upon their Fathers: Nor can they be juſtly blamed for ſo doing, until any man can ſhew me that the Father hath ſome better Right than meer Cuſtom or Power.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to the conſideration of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places he produces out of Scripture, for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right of Fathers to be Kings over their Deſcendants. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> p. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As for the example of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; for here the Grandſon of <hi>Ham,</hi> who ought to have been a Servant to the Children of <hi>Shem</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50833:23"/> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> interrupting this Paternal Empire, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers and tyrannizes not onely over his own Family, but the Deſcendants of the elder Brethren. But Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> (of which opinion the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is) will have him to be Lord over his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, by Right of Succeſſion; but to enlarge his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire againſt Right, by ſeizing violently on the Rights of other Lords of Families.</p>
               <p>But however, after the confuſion of Tongues, the Author will have it revive again; and <hi>the diſtinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereupon erected, were not confuſed Multitudes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heads or Governours, and at liberty to chuſe what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours they pleaſed; but they were diſtinct Families which had Fathers for Rulers over them: whereby it plainly appears, that even in this confuſion God was careful to preſerve the Fatherly Authority, by diſtributing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Languages according to the diverſity of Families.</hi> For ſo it appears by the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.5.20.22.</p>
               <p>But theſe places will not prove what the Author quotes them for, <hi>viz.</hi> the Monarchical or Kingly power of Fathers: for neither does the Scripture or <hi>Joſephus</hi> mention, that this diviſion of the World by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Poſterity was performed by the Fathers of theſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as abſolute Monarchs; but it rather ſeems that their Children and Deſcendants followed them as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, as retaining a Reverence and Affection to their perſons for their great age, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and care of their Families: Which <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Will. Temple</hi>'s Eſſay of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>p.</hi> 67.</note> an ingenious modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor conceives to be the natural ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all Governments, ſpringing from a tacite defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Authority of one ſingle perſon. And of this opinion is excellent <hi>Pufendorf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of this kind were thoſe firſt Kings which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> calls Heroical, <hi>whom the People did obey of their own accord, becauſe they deſerved well of them, and either
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50833:24"/> by teaching them Arts, or by warring for them, or by gathering them together when they were diſperſed, or by dividing Lands among them. Secondly,</hi> If it were true that theſe Fathers of Families were ſo many abſolute Kings, yet it quite deſtroys the Author's <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> who will have but one true Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> who if he could be known, had a natural Right to be Monarch of the whole world. <hi>And though Kings now</hi> (Patriarch. p. 19.) <hi>are not the natural Parents of their Subjects, yet they all either are, or are to be reputed Heirs to thoſe firſt Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who were at firſt natural Parents of the People, and in their right ſucceed to the exerciſe of Supreme Juriſdiction; and ſuch Heirs are not only Lords of their own Children, but alſo of their Brethren, and all others that were ſubject to their Fathers.</hi> Whereas we ſee here no ſuch right of Elderſhip obſerved, neither among the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> nor their deſcendants; but every one, as appears from the words of the Text, was an independant Head &amp; Leader of his own Family: by theſe were the Iſles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles divided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the deſcendants of <hi>Shem,</hi> were the Nations divided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe the other places he brings concerning the Sons of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> do deſtroy the Authours notion of an Heir to the Authority of the Father, or that any Son is more Lord of his Brethren than another. For all the Sons of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> are reckon'd as ſo many inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Princes, or Dukes, and Lords of diſtinct Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, without any Superiority in the eldeſt Son, who ought by the Authours Principle to have been abſolute Lord over the reſt: And if theſe could divide themſelves into as many diſtinct Governments as there were Sons, Why might not they do ſo <hi>in infinitum?</hi> And then there could never be any common Prince or Monarch ſet over them all, but by Force or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or elſe by Election; either of which deſtroys the notion of the Natural Right of Elderſhip. And
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50833:24"/> as for the places he brings to prove it; 1. Gods words to <hi>Gain</hi> concerning <hi>Abel,</hi> will not do it, <hi>His deſires ſhall be ſubject unto thee, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi> For firſt, this might be ſpoken only perſonally to <hi>Cain,</hi> and not to give a Right to all Eldeſt Sons. Secondly, the words do not ſignifie an abſolute Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Power, but a ruling or governing by perſwaſion or fair means; as when a man is ruled, that is, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by another in his concerns. Then as for the bleſſing upon <hi>Jacob</hi> by his Father <hi>Iſaac, Be Lord over thy Brethren, and let the Sons of thy Mother bow before thee,</hi> 'twas never litterally fulfilled. For <hi>Jacob</hi> was never Lord over <hi>Eſau,</hi> who was a Prince of Mount <hi>Seir</hi> in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s life-time, whilſt <hi>Jacob</hi> was at beſt but Lord of his own family. And as for bowing and other Rights of Superiority, we read [<hi>Gen.</hi> 33.3.] that <hi>Jacob,</hi> at his Interview with his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> called him Lord, and bowed ſeven times to the ground before he came to him. So that this Text is no more than a Prophecy, to ſhew why the Jews, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſhould have Right in After-times to rule over the <hi>Edomites,</hi> or Poſterity of <hi>Eſau.</hi> Laſtly, this Example makes againſt the Authour: for it ſeems it is not the Eldeſt Son, but whom the Father pleaſes to appoint, is Heir after his death: Since here <hi>Eſau</hi> looſes his Birth right by his own act, but chiefly by his Fathers Will.</p>
               <p>Yet if after all, ſome will urge from the Principles I have laid down, that it ſeems more to conduce to the happineſs and peace of Families, and in that to the great end I have before laid down, the common good of Mankinde, rather to allow this abſolute Power of Life and Death to Parents over their Children, and an abſolute Subjection to them as long as they live; ſince Parents do uſually take that care to breed up their Children, and to have that tender Affection towards
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50833:25"/> them, that they will ſeldom take away their Lives, or ſell them for Slaves, or keep them ſo themſelves, unleſs there be very great cauſe; of which the Father only ought to be Judge, ſince it being the nature of moſt Children to be apt to contradict and diſobey their Fathers commands, or perhaps reſiſt them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending they would kill them, when they only go about to give them due correction; And ſince moſt young people hate reſtraint, and love to be gadding abroad, they having a Right by theſe Principles to judge when they are able to ſhift for themſelves, would take any ſlight pretence to run away from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſoon as they were grown pretty big, and ſo perhaps leave their Parents in their old Age, when they had no body to take care of them: whereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confuſion and quarrels would happen in Families, great miſchief to the Parents, and often ruine to the Children; who being often opiniatred, and ſelf-will'd, would think better of their own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities than they really deſerved. And therefore divers Nations ſeeing theſe great Inconveniencies, did by their Laws leave Parents the Power of Life and Death over their Children. <hi>Such were</hi> (thoſe the Author inſtances in) <hi>the</hi> Perſians, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Patriarcha,</hi> p. 38. chap. 2.</note> Gauls, <hi>and many Nations in the</hi> Weſt-Indies: <hi>And the</hi> Romans <hi>even in their Popular State had this Law in force: Which Power of Parents was ratified and amplified by the Laws of the</hi> XII Tables, <hi>enabling of Parents to ſell their Children three times. And the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>gives full power to the Father to ſtone his diſobedient Son, ſo it be done in preſence of a Magiſtrate. And yet it did not belong to the Magiſtrate to inquire and examine the juſtneſs of the cauſe; but it was ſo ordained, leſt the Father ſhould in his Anger ſuddenly or ſecretly kill his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer, that ſince this Argument
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50833:25"/> quits the natural Power of a Father by Generation, and only ſticks to the acquired one of education, and appeals to the common good of Mankinde; I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it is a better than any of the reſt. Yet I think it is not true, that Parents in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would more ſeldome abuſe their power, than Children would this Natural Liberty I here allow them, of defending and providing for themſelves in caſes of extreme Danger and Neceſſity. For this Temptation to do ill is greater on the Fathers ſide, than that of the Children: For they looking on themſelves as having an abſolute and unqueſtionable power over them, and that they may deal with them as they pleaſe, are apt to think themſelves ſlighted and diſobeyed by their Children, perhaps on very light occaſions; and their Paſſion often riſes to that height (as not conſidering the Follies and Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs of Youth) that they may, if Cholerick or Ill-natur'd, ſtrike them with that which may either kill them, or elſe cripple or maim them; and perhaps out of an immoderate Anger, or being weary of them, murder them on purpoſe. And Fathers being more apt, as having oftner occaſion to be angry with their Children, than their Children with them, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to me, that in the ſtate of Nature (where there is no Magiſtrate to keep the Father in awe) Fathers will be as apt to kill or maim their Children, as Children their Parents. And if the Fathers (as I ſaid before) are intended for the good and preſervation of their Child; and that where their Right ceaſes, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Right to preſerve themſelves takes place: It ſeems to conduce more to the general good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, that the Children ſhould make uſe of this laſt refuge of defending themſelves, when they cannot otherwiſe preſerve their Lives and Members, than that Fathers ſhould have ſuch an abſolute Right to deal
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50833:26"/> with them as they pleaſed, without any power in the Children to reſiſt or defend themſelves. So likewiſe Fathers being ſo much older, underſtand their own advantage better than their Children; and being ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ill-natur'd, and often (by reaſon of their Age) more covetous than they, may be tempted to ſell their Children for Slaves, whereby they may fall into a condition worſe than Death itſelf; and may not the Son then endeavour to run away, or uſe all lawful means poſſible to eſcape ſo great a miſery? Or if the Father will keep his Son as a Slave all the days of his life, without any hopes of ever being free? For when the Father dies, the Son (according to this Authour) is to be Servant to his Eldeſt Brother, or to whomever elſe his Father pleaſed to bequeath him. Is not the caſe the ſame? And as for the quiet of the Family, which is ſuppoſed to be preſerved by the Sons abſolute ſubmiſſion, rather than his reſiſtance in any circumſtance, I think it would rather increaſe Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by encouraging of Fathers to uſe their Power over their Children, not as Reaſon, but Drunkenneſs or Paſſion may impel them: Whereas this Right of Children in defending their Lives, and not being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to give them up at their Fathers pleaſure, will rather make Parents act moderately and diſcreetly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Children, when they know they are not obliged to ſtay or bear with them upon other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than that they may enjoy their Lives in ſafety, and the ordinary means thereof with ſome comfort. Not that I give Children any Right, as I ſaid before, to diſobey their Parents, or reſiſt them upon every ſlight occaſion; but rather to bear with their Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as far as it is poſſible; And to ſuffer divers Hardſhips and Inconveniencies from them, rather than to reſiſt or leave them; conſidering the great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they owe them. So that I do not allow this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50833:26"/> Remedy, but in caſe of extreme Neceſſity, yet of which the Sufferer only in the ſtate of Nature can be Judge; ſince in that ſtate where there is no Umpire, (without both their conſents) but God only, every man is Judge when his Life is in danger.</p>
               <p>And if the Peace of Mankinde were to be procured merely by a mans Sufferance and Submiſſion, without any reſpect to this Right, then it would be his duty to give himſelf up to be robb'd or kill'd by any one who had the wickedneſs to attempt it; becauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being innocent, may go to Heaven; and the other being guilty of an intent to rob or murder, may be damned if he be killed. And beſides, it would more conduce to the preſervation of Mankinde, that but one man ſhould be loſt, whereas by reſiſtance they may both periſh. Yet I ſuppoſe no man is ſo ſottiſh, as to hold he ought quit his own preſervation in theſe caſes; or if he do hold it for diſcourſe ſake, I am ſure he would not be ſo mad as to obſerve it. For this were ſuch an Argument, as to hold, Becauſe ſome men may abuſe that Law of Self-preſervation to another mans deſtruction; Therefore it were unlawful to defend a mans ſelf at all.</p>
               <p>As for the Examples of thoſe Nations and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths who have permitted Fathers to exerciſe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick Power over their Children; The Law of Nature or right Reaſon, is not to be gathered from the Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Laws or Cuſtoms of any particular Nation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which are often different and contrary to each other. Therefore as to the Jewiſh Law, though I will not ſay it was contrary to the Law of Nature, yet it was extremely rigorous and ſevere in all its diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and does not now oblige Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths in this particular, as in divers others, much leſs in the ſtate of Nature. And as for the <hi>Romans,</hi> they ſaw the inconveniencies of this Abſolute Power,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50833:27"/> and retrenched it by degrees, until it came to be no more than now with us, and in moſt Countreys of <hi>Europe.</hi> So likewiſe the Arguments which <hi>Bodin</hi> brings for the abſolute power of Parents over their Children, depending upon the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, may be eaſily anſwered from theſe grounds.</p>
               <p>Having, as I hope, clear'd this main point of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Authority, and of Natural Obedience, without giving an extravagant power to Parents on the one hand to abuſe their power, or a priviledge to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on the other ſide to be ſtubborn or diſobedient to their Parents; If then this Paternal Authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend farther than I have ſeated it, I ſhall own my ſelf beholding to any Friend of the Authour's, or his Opinions, to ſhew me my errour. But if they cannot, I deſire they would conſider, whether this natural Right of Kings which the Authour aſſerts precedent to any compact or civil conſtitution, can extend farther than the natural Authority of Fathers, from whom they are ſuppoſed to derive it, and on which it is founded. And if it appears that Princes have ſuch Power as our Fathers, then all that the Authour hath writ on this ſubject ſignifies juſt nothing.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall now proceed to examine the reſt of his Principles; and ſhall I hope prove, that (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this Fatherly Power as abſolute as the Authour fancies) yet that his Divine Abſolute Monarchy cannot however be derived from thence.</p>
               <p>The Authour ſeems to think it a Queſtion very eaſie to be anſwered. If any one asks what comes of this Right of Fatherhood, in caſe the Crown, Fatherly power, eſcheat for want of an Heir, whether it fall to the People, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Patriarch.</hi> P. 20.</note> or what elſe becomes of it? To which his Anſwer is, <hi>That it is but the Negligence or Ignorance of the People to looſe the knowledg of the true Heir; for an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50833:27"/> Heir there is always. If</hi> Adam <hi>were ſtill living, and now were ready to die, it is certain that there is but one Man, and but one in the world, who is next Heir; although the knowledge who ſhould be that one Man be quite loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this fine Notion ſignifies nothing now, for <hi>Adam</hi> being dead, and his right Heir not to be known, it is all one as if he had none; ſince, for ought I know to the contrary, the Authors Footman may be the Man. But to help this, the Author hath found out a couple of Expedients, (ſuch as they be;) The firſt is, <note place="margin">Directions for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>p.</hi> 69.</note> 
                  <hi>That an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper of this Power, where the knowledge of the right Heir is loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in by poſſeſſion, is to be taken and reputed for the true Heir, and is to be obeyed by them as their Father.</hi> And if this will not do, he gives us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and tells us, <note place="margin">Patriarch. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>The Government in this caſe is not devolved upon the multitude; but the Kingly power eſcheats in ſuch caſes to the Fathers and independent Heads of Families: For every Kingdom is reſolved into thoſe parts of which it was firſt made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each of which we will examine in their turn. To begin with the former, let us ſee if it be ſo eaſie a thing as the Authour makes it, to know who was <hi>Adam</hi>'s, or any Monarch's right Heir (ſetting the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Laws of the Country aſide;) ſo that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot be excuſed of wilful Ignorance or Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, if they looſe this knowledg. Where by the way I obſerve, that as eaſie a thing as it was to know who was <hi>Adam</hi>'s right Heir, and upon whom by the Laws of God and Nature the Crown is to deſcend, upon the Death of the Monarch; yet he no where poſitively anſwers this important Queſtion: For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is to claim by deſcent, as in this inſtance of the Heir of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſometimes by his Father's laſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50833:28"/> Will, as in the caſe of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons, according as the Examples out of Scripture do beſt ſerve his turn. So that I believe he did not either negligently or ignorantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſettling this point, becauſe he might ſtill have a hole left to creep out at, or elſe becauſe he could do it no better than the Inſtances he brings would permit.</p>
               <p>He ſays, [Direct. for Obedience, <hi>pag.</hi> 68.] <hi>A Son is always to live under the ſubjection of his Father, unleſs by Gods immediate appointment, or by the Grant or Death of his Father, he become himſelf poſſeſs'd of that Power to which he was ſubject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which words he ſeems to imply, that this Power is to deſcend to the Eldeſt Son, when his Father dies. So likewiſe in this Treatiſe we are now upon, [<hi>P.</hi> 12.] he ſays, <hi>Civil Power not only in general is by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but even the aſſignment of it ſpecifically to the eldeſt Parents.</hi> By which words I ſuppoſe he means, (if any thing) eldeſt Sons; though I know not why he ſhould limit it to Parents: for methinks it were very hard the eldeſt Son ſhould forfeit his Right, in caſe he were not a Parent when his Father died. So likewiſe he tells us, [P. 19.] <hi>That theſe Heirs of this Fatherly Power, are not only Lords of their own Children, but alſo of their Brethren, and all others that were ſubject to their Father.</hi> Yet tells us not plainly which of the Sons is Heir; only ſays a little before, <hi>That when God made choice of any ſpecial Perſon to be King, he always inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Iſſue alſo ſhould have the benefit thereof.</hi> Though this general Rule was falſe in the caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> whoſe Children were diſinherited by God to eſtabliſh the Crown upon <hi>David</hi> and his Line. So uncertain things are Inſtances drawn from Scripture without any due conſideration of the Reaſon of them.</p>
               <p>But to return to the ſubject: I grant that it is not impoſſible but from the command of a Father of a Family, who hath divers other Families under him,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50833:28"/> there may ſpring a Civil Government, though the Fatherly Authority doth properly regard the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Children, and the Maſterly Power to encreaſe Riches: And though it is not changed barely by the great number of Children or Servants; yet the difference between them is not ſo wide, that there can be no tranſition from one to the other, unleſs a new Right of Soveraign Majeſty be produced by God. For if a Father of a Family being provided of a great ſtock of Children and Slaves, will by way of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion permit them to enjoy their own Goods and Families apart, on that condition that they ſubmit to his Government for their common Security; I do not ſee what is wanting to the making him a Prince, if he have ſtrength ſufficient to perform the ends of a Commonwealth. But he dying, and nominating a Succeſſour, if his Sons will conſent to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Will, they may if they pleaſe; if not, all of them, as in an Interregnum, may appoint what ſort of Government they will have for the future. Nor will the Law of Nature be violated, if the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Son, having moſt Votes, ſhould be elected in his Fathers ſtead.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad any man could demonſtrate to me from the Laws of God and Nature, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s eldeſt Son was by the Right of Elderſhip to be Lord over his Brethren, without their Election or Conſent, when their Father died. Indeed the Jewiſh Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd a preheminence to the Elder Brother, and that he ſhould have a double portion, and be reverenced by all his Brethren, expreſt by this Phraſe of, <hi>Let thy Mothers Sons bow before thee:</hi> But this proves not that as Eldeſt Son he had therefore a Right of exerciſing all that Authority, upon the Death of their Father, over his Brethren, which his Father had before: Neither had <hi>Jacob</hi> any ſuch Right over <hi>Eſau,</hi> though he ſold
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50833:29"/> his Birthright, or the eldeſt or any other Son of <hi>Jacob</hi> any ſuch Right over his Brethren; for certainly God would not have abrogated it if they had. So that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Authority as a Father, ended with his Life: and for any Deſpotick Propriety or Dominion over them, I have already proved that the Father has none in the ſtate of Nature. Yet admitting he had, the Children notwithſtanding would have been free at his Death. For Servitude being a mere perſonal Duty, due only to the perſon of him that acquired this Slave; when the perſon dies to whom he owed this ſubjection, the Slave is free in the ſtate of Nature, unleſs the Lord of this Slave transferr'd his Right in him to another in his life-time; a mans Perſon not being like a brute beaſt, to be ſeiz'd by whoever can lay hold of him; he hath no longer any obligation to ſerve his Children, (unleſs he will make himſelf their Slave of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.) But if it be anſwered, that the Father may bequeath this Right of Dominion over his Children at his Death, by his Will, to which of his Sons he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and that he that is ſo conſtituted by their Father, is Lord over all the reſt of his Brethren; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove this from <hi>Geneſis</hi> the 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 26, 27. where <hi>Noah</hi> curſing <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ham</hi> his Father had derided his nakedneſs, ſays, <hi>He ſhall be a Servant unto his Brethren:</hi> I deſire you would take notice, that this Anſwer quite gives up the Natural Right of the Heir, or Eldeſt Son. 2. I ſuppoſe this rather was a Prediction or Curſe to be fulfilled in <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than upon himſelf. For firſt, this Right was not given, as it ought to have been, over the Perſon of <hi>Ham</hi> the Offender, <note place="margin">

                  </gap> to both alike; ſaying both of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> that <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhould be their Servant: which could not be meant of his perſon, ſince that could not be divided by them both, who were like to live at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; therefore it can onely ſignifie, that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants ſhould be ſlaves to the others. And ſeveral Commentators upon this place, do ſuppoſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> related this Curſe of <hi>Noah</hi> upon <hi>Ham,</hi> onely to ſhew the Jews the Right they had to make ſlaves of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> becauſe they were deſcended from <hi>Canaan.</hi> And as for the Right of bequeathing ſlaves by Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is much diſputed whether by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Teſtaments have any force in this caſe; thoſe that have written of it, being much divided about it in the ſtate of Nature, ſince all Propriety in that ſtate being but Occupancy or Poſſeſſion, which ceaſes with the life of the Occupant. Therefore ſince a Teſtament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences onely from the Teſtators death, who as ſoon as he died, loſt his Right in the Goods bequeathed, ſince the dead can have no intereſt in any thing; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Legatee ſuſtain the perſon of the Teſtator, ſince this Right ceaſed before that of the Legatees could begin. So that it ſeems to me at preſent, that the power of bequeathing either the perſons of men or goods, was but a conſequence of an abſolute Propriety in things which ariſes from Compact in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as I ſhall hereafter prove.</p>
               <p>Therefore out of this State, a Will cannot bind the perſons of the Children or Servants ſo bequeathed: And for this cauſe we find <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. binding his Servant that ruled over his Houſe, with an Oath not to take a Wife for his Son of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Land. And <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Jacob</hi> taking an Oath of <hi>Joſeph</hi> not to bury him in <hi>Egypt;</hi> becauſe they doubted whether they could oblige them to do it by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50833:30"/> their Teſtament. But as for the Right of bequeathing Crowns or Kingdoms by Teſtament, as I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that ſome Kingdoms may have been ſo bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thable by their Conſtitution, and others become ſo by Cuſtom; yet I cannot grant that this Right belonged to the Prince or Monarch by the Law of God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but proceeds purely from a continued Cuſtom of the Kingdom, or Civil Law thereof; elſe why had not <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, or <hi>Edward</hi> VI, power to limit or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath the Crown to whom they pleaſed, as well as <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour? And to look into other Countries, what now renders Women uncapable of ſucceeding to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> yet capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting that of <hi>England, Spain,</hi> and divers other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Europe,</hi> but the Cuſtoms or particular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Eſtates of theſe Kingdoms? which no Will or Teſtament can alter. What elſe hinders the Grand Seignior, that he cannot diſinherit his eldeſt Son if he ſurvive him, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Mezeray Abregé</hi> Chron. <hi>An.</hi> 1317. <hi>Phil. le Long.</hi>
                  </note> but the Cuſtom of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire? And what is this Cuſtom, but (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf acknowledges in the caſe of <hi>England</hi>) the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom Law of the Country, <note place="margin">

So that it was the Will of the People, and not the Prince alone, that made this a Law: for if this Law of the Succeſſion of the Crown depended upon his Will, then if he be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarch, that (when ſufficiently declared) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely Law, might alter it when he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and ſo he might bequeath the Crown to whom he pleaſed. But every one that underſtands the preſent Laws of Deſcent of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Succeſſion in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, knows that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50833:30"/> the King of <hi>France</hi> or Grand Seignior (as abſolute as they are) ſhould bequeath their Kingdoms to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the right Heir, this Will would ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and no body would obey this Succeſſor of their appointing. And if any man think to evade this, by ſaying, That the Succeſſion of the Crown is a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of the Government, and that a Prince may be Abſolute, and yet not have a power to alter that as he may every thing elſe; I would ask him who made this a Fundamental Law at firſt, whether the King then in being, or the King with the Conſent of the People, upon the firſt inſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If the King made it alone, ſince he is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have made it at firſt for the good of the People, of which he is the Judge (and is ſuppoſed in Law ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to die) why then is not he as competent a Judge of what is good for the People now, as a King that lived a thouſand years agone was what was fit for the People then? and conſequently hath as much Right of altering the Succeſſion for the Peoples benefit, as he that eſtabliſhed it at firſt, ſince every Law may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the ſame Power that made it? But if he ſay it is a Fundamental Law, becauſe long cuſtom hath made it ſo, then it is apparent ſuch a Law hath its force from the Conſent of the People at firſt or ſince, Cuſtom being nothing elſe. Or laſtly, if he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Conſent of the People was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make this a Fundamental Conſtitution, then it can neither be altered without their Conſent; and ſo conſequently no Princes Teſtament is good as to that, farther than the People or their Repreſentatives give their aſſent thereunto: And the ſame Law holds in the Father of a Family, ſince this Author will have no difference between him and a King, but onely <hi>ſecundum Magis &amp; Minus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then there be no Right in the ſtate of Nature for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50833:31"/> a Father to bequeath his Dominion over his Children by his Teſtament, let us return again to that of Deſcent, and ſee if that will prove a better foundation to build this natural Right of Princes upon. For my part, I think that it is not onely impoſſible to know who was <hi>Adam</hi>'s right Heir of his Fatherly Power now, after five or ſix thouſand years, but might likewiſe be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, as ſoon as ever the breath was out of his body: For ſuppoſing <hi>Eve</hi> ſurvived him, why ſhould not her natural Right of governing the Children which ſhe her ſelf brought forth (and which out of Wedlock would have belonged to her) revive and take place before any Right of her eldeſt Son; to whom upon this ground ſhe muſt have become ſubject, if ſhe would continue part of the Family or natural Commonwealth, (which ſhe could not avoid, there being none but her Children or Grandchildren in the world) and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the nature of Government to allow two Abſolute Heads in the ſame Family or Commonwealth? So that for ought I ſee, the Mother of the Family hath the beſt Right to the Government in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after the Husbands death, upon the Authors own grounds: For if the Commandment of <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> ſignifie more than bare Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Reſpect, as appears by the Apoſtles Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Commandment, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Children, obey your Parents in the Lord,</hi> which he makes the ſame with <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother;</hi> then this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which was due to the Father, belongs likewiſe to her when his power ceaſes.</p>
               <p>But paſſing over this difficulty, and allowing this Fatherly Authority to deſcend to <hi>Adam</hi>'s next Heir, it might have been a great Queſtion, who this next Heir was, ſuppoſing <hi>Cain</hi> to have been diſinherited for the murder of <hi>Abel,</hi> and to have gone away and built a City, and ſet up a Government by himſelf? Yet let
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50833:31"/> us ſuppoſe <hi>Abel</hi> left a Son behind him, who ſurvived <hi>Adam</hi> his Grandfather; which he might very well do, and yet the Scripture be ſilent in it, ſince the intent of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Genealogies being onely to give us the Pedigree of the Jews, and therefore ſays little of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Children but by the by. I would ask the Author or any man elſe, who was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heir after his death, whether this Son of <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Seth;</hi> (whom we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe likewiſe to have ſurvived his Father?) If he ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> might leave it to <hi>Seth</hi> by Will, this is <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis dictum;</hi> and it lies upon him to prove that <hi>Adam</hi> made a Will; or if he did, how it could bind his true Heir. If he ſay that <hi>Seth</hi> ought to ſucceed and govern his Brethren, as being nearer in bloud to <hi>Adam,</hi> what reaſon was there that the eldeſt Son's ſon ſhould be puniſhed and loſe his Birthright for that which was not his fault, but misfortune, <hi>viz.</hi> that his Father was murdered before his Grandfather died? Nor could <hi>Seth</hi> claim, being elder and conſequently wiſer than his Nephew: for his Nephew muſt be older, ſince <hi>Seth</hi> was not born until after <hi>Abel</hi> was killed. But if it be affirmed, that the eldeſt Son of <hi>Abel</hi> ought to ſucceed and repreſent his Father; I ask, by what Law? If it be replied, that it is to be ſuppoſed that <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had made a Will, would rather have had his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſucceed him than his younger Son; this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and were to affirm that the Right of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is bequeathable; which I have already confuted. But if it be ſaid, that this Son of <hi>Abels</hi> ſhould ſucceed becauſe he repreſents his Father; I would ask them, by what Law this Right of Repreſentation ſhould take place before propinquity of Bloud? or how could the Fathers expectation onely confer a Right to his Son, in that which the Father was never poſſeſſed of? So that there being equal Reaſons on both ſides, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law nor Precedent in the caſe, there remained no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50833:32"/> way to decide this Controverſie, but either Combate, or the Judgment or Arbitration of the reſt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Deſcendants. I ſuppoſe the Author will not allow the former ſufficient to confer a good Title, ſince the beſt Title might have the worſt ſucceſs in that Appeal to the Sword. If he allows the latter, then this heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Monarchy of <hi>Adam</hi> became Elective, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Will of all the Heads of the Families which deſcended from <hi>Adam:</hi> (For it is not likely in ſo doubtful and material a point as who ſhould govern, any of them would loſe the priviledge of giving his Vote.) And if ſo, this Right of Succeſſion depended upon their Wills, which might give it to which of the two Competitors they liked beſt; and this being once done, might for quietneſs paſs into a Cuſtom or Law for the future. And that this Right of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the Son dies before his Father, cannot be decided by the Law of Nature or Reaſon alone, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in that divers Nations or diſtinct Tribes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have had different Cuſtoms about it, and have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed this Right of Succeſſion divers ways: For though the Roman or Civil Law allow of this Right of Repreſentation, yet the <hi>Germans</hi> and all Nations deſcended from them, did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it until very lately; <note place="margin">See <hi>Grotius de J. B. Li.</hi> cap. 7.</note> which ſhews there is nothing but Cuſtom in the caſe. And upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the League in <hi>France</hi> admitted the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> King, by the name of <hi>Charles</hi> the X, before his Nephew the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> his elder Brothers Son, who died before him. And that this difficulty who ſhall ſucceed, the Uncle or the Nephew, hath ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext mankind in all Countries where the Succeſſion hath not been ſettled by poſitive Laws or long Cuſtom, (which is but the continued Will of the People) may appear by thoſe different Judgments that have been
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50833:32"/> in all Ages made on this matter: for when there aroſe a Controverſie between <hi>Areus,</hi> Son of <hi>Acrotatus,</hi> eldeſt Son to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> the ſecond Son of the ſaid <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> the Senate adjudged the Royalty for <hi>Areus</hi> againſt <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi> But in <hi>Spain,</hi>

And when <hi>Charles</hi> the II, King of <hi>Sicily</hi> died, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vicerius in Vita</hi> Henry 7.</note> and left a Grandſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him by his eldeſt Son, ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Martel,</hi> and a younger Son called <hi>Robert;</hi> the matter being referred to Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> V, he gave judgment for <hi>Robert</hi> the younger Son of <hi>Charles;</hi> who was thereupon proclaimed King of <hi>Sicily.</hi> And it ſeems <hi>Glanvil,</hi> who was Lord Chief Juſtice under <hi>Henry</hi> II, makes it a great Queſtion who ſhould be preferred to the Crown, the Uncle or the Nephew. So that it was no ſtrange thing for King <hi>John</hi> to make himſelf King before his Nephew <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> ſince it was a moot point among the Lawyers of that Age, who ought to ſucceed. And where no Power could intervene, it was decided by War, and ſometimes ſingle Combats, which Hiſtorians mention to have been waged between Uncles and Nephews contending for the Principality; and not onely in this caſe, but in all others where the Succeſſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is not ſettled by ſuch Laws or Cuſtoms, it lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually liable to be diſputed between the Sons or Grandſons of the laſt Prince, nor can ever be decided but by the Sword: Of which there is an Example in one of the greateſt and moſt abſolute Monarchies in the world, <hi>viz.</hi> the Empire of the <hi>Mogul,</hi> where for

So that every one provides for himſelf, and makes his Party as ſtrong as he can by Gifts and Promiſes among the Grandees, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Fathers death. Nay, lately this prize hath been played among the Sons even in their Fathers life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, as in the caſe of the late <hi>Sha-Jehan,</hi> who lived to ſee all his Sons killed, and his perſon made a priſoner by his youngeſt Son <hi>Aureng Zebe,</hi> who is for ought I know, <hi>Mogul</hi> at this day. And if any man thinks this onely an Evil peculiar to this Empire, and not to others, let him but read the Hiſtories of the ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions and Changes in all Mooriſh and Eaſtern Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, and he ſhall find them managed much after the ſame rate. Nor hath theſe differences onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided theſe Monarchies where the Succeſſion was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well ſettled at firſt, but even thoſe that have been better conſtituted, and where one would belieev the Diſcent of the Crown had been ſufficiently ſettled by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50833:33"/> a long Diſcent of Kings for many hundreds of years. And of this, <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been a famous Example; where after the death of King <hi>Alexander</hi> III, and his Grandaughter <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> two or three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Competitors claimed a Right to ſucceed: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting others, it was agreed that it lay between <hi>John Baylliol,</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> Earl of <hi>Carick;</hi> both of them drawing their Diſcent from <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> Great Uncle to the laſt King (in whom they all agreed the Right to the Crown would have been, had he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.) <hi>Baylliol</hi> claimed, as eldeſt Son to <hi>Dornagilla,</hi> Grandaughter to <hi>Margaret</hi> the eldeſt Daughter of the ſaid Earl <hi>David. Robert Bruce</hi> claimed, as eldeſt Son of <hi>Iſabel</hi> the ſecond Daughter of the ſaid <hi>David.</hi> So that if <hi>Baylliol</hi> alledged his Diſcent from the eldeſt Daughter, <hi>Bruce</hi> was not behind-hand; but pleaded, though it was true he was deſcended but from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Daughter, yet he being a Grandſon, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree neerer, ought to ſucceed; (whereas <hi>Baylliol</hi> was but great Grandſon to Earl <hi>David:</hi>) And though <hi>Dornagilla, Baylliol</hi>'s Mother, was in the ſame degree with himſelf, yet he being a man, ought to be preferred before a woman in the ſame Line; and that if the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> would have given it to <hi>Dornagilla,</hi> if it had been an ordinary Inheritance, yet Diſcent of the Crown was not to be ruled by the Common Laws of other Inheritances. In ſhort, this Diſpute did ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Nobility into Factions, and puzzle the Eſtates of the Kingdom, that not being able to decide it, they and all the Competitors agreed to refer the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to <hi>Edward</hi> I. King of <hi>England,</hi> one of the wiſeſt and moſt powerful Princes of his time; who upon long advice and debate with twelve of the learnedeſt men of both Kingdoms, at laſt adjudged the Crown to <hi>Baylliol;</hi> or, as the Scotch Hiſtorians relate, becauſe he would do him Homage for it: which, <hi>Bruce</hi> being of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50833:34"/> a higher ſpirit, refuſed. Yet this did not put an end to this great Controverſie; for though <hi>Baylliol</hi> was thereupon admitted King, yet falling out not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with King <hi>Edward,</hi> to whom he owed all his greatneſs, and having the worſt of it, the Nobility and States of <hi>Scotland</hi> revived <hi>Bruce</hi>'s Title, and declared him King; who after a long War with <hi>England,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the Crown quietly at laſt, and left it to his Iſſue, whoſe Poſterity (in our preſent King) enjoy it to this day.</p>
               <p>To this I ſhall adde one Example more from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> within theſe hundred years. King <hi>Henry</hi> called the Cardinal dying without Iſſue, there was a great Controverſie who ſhould ſucceed; (for he died ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly juſt as the States of the Kingdom were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſettle the Succeſſion, for he declared himſelf unable to decide it:) So that he onely left by his Will twelve Governours of the Kingdom, who ſhould govern during the <hi>interregnum,</hi> but that the Crown ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to him that ſhould appear to them to have the beſt Title. Four eminent Competitors put in their claims: 1. <hi>Antonio</hi> called the Baſtard, who nevertheleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he was lawful Son to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſecond Brother to <hi>Henry</hi> the laſt King: So that he had no more to do but to prove himſelf Legitimate. 2. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who claimed as Grandſon to <hi>Mary,</hi> eldeſt Daughter to Don <hi>Duarte,</hi> youngeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the laſt King <hi>Henry,</hi> and Son to King <hi>Emanuel.</hi> 3. The Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who claimed as Son to <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> ſecond Daughter of the ſaid Don <hi>Duarte,</hi> yet alledged his Title to be beſt, becauſe he was the next of the Bloud-Royal who was a Native of <hi>Portugal</hi> (as the Heir of the Crown, as he pretended, ought to be by a Fundamental Law of that Kingdom:) yet it ſeems that Law was not then ſo well known, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there was no reaſon why theſe Governors ſhould
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50833:34"/> not have admitted him King as ſoon as ever they met. 4. <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who claimed as Son to <hi>Iſabella</hi> Daughter of <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſo a degree nearer than the reſt to <hi>Henry</hi> the laſt King. The States and Governours differing, the States were diſſolved; and during their receſs, the Governours not agreeing among themſelves, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> raiſed an Army, and entering <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſeiz'd the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and conſequently all the reſt of the Kingdom ſubmitted to him, and ſo made himſelf King by force. And yet we have ſeen in his Grandſon's time, the Eſtates of <hi>Portugal</hi> declare this Title void, and the Crown ſetled in the Poſterity of the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who ſtill enjoy it by vertue of this Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law. And that this Fundamental Law could not be altered but by the conſent of the Cortes or States, appears by the late Alteration of this Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Treaty of Marriage of the preſent Prince Regents Daughter with the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> And how much even Kings themſelves have attributed to the Authority of their Eſtates, appears by the League made between <hi>Philip</hi> the Long King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots;</hi> wherein this Condition was expreſt, That if there ſhould happen any difference about the Succeſſion in either of theſe Realms, he of the two Kings which remained alive, ſhould not ſuffer any to place himſelf on the Throne, but him who ſhould have the Judgment of the Eſtates of his ſide; and then he ſhould with all his power oppoſe him who would after this conteſt for the Crown. So that our Author, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, lays the fault upon the wilful ignorance of the People in not remembring or acknowledging the right Heir of the Crown; when the ableſt and wiſeſt men of the Age they lived in could not by the meer Laws of Nature and Reaſon, determine which was he: And our Author ſhould have done well to have ſet
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50833:35"/> down ſome certain Rules, how the People might be aſſured, without a poſitive Law before made, that they acknowledge the right Heir, and not an Uſurper to his prejudice.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Obſervations on the Directions for Obedience in doubtful times, and other places of his <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> and other Treatiſes.</head>
               <p>BUT ſince this Author, rather than the diſpoſal of a Crown ſhall fall to the deciſion of the People, or States of the Kingdom, will give an Uſurper a good Right to it againſt all perſons but him that hath the Right; we will now examine how much of that is true which he lays down in his Directions for Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Governours in doubtful times, and how far men are bound in Conſcience to obey an Uſurper, whilſt he that hath Right is kept out by him. Firſt, he takes it for granted, that all thoſe that ſo eagerly ſtrive for an original Power to be in the People, do with one accord acknowledge that originally the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power was in the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Mezeray Abregé</hi> Chron. An. 1318.</note> and that the firſt Kings were Fathers of Families; which if granted, yet will not prove that this proceeded from that natural perpetual ſubjection which Children owe their Parents; or that becauſe they are Parents, they are therefore Lords and Kings over them: So that this being the Groundwork of whatever he ſays in this Diſcourſe, <hi>p.</hi> 67. if this be faulty (as I hope I have proved it to be) all that he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50833:35"/> builds upon this foundation, ſignifies nothing. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he aſſumes that this Paternal power cannot be loſt; it may be transferr'd or uſurped, but never loſt, or ceaſeth — <hi>But as the power of the Father may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully transferred or aliened, ſo it may be unjuſtly uſurped; and in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation the Title of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper is before and better than the Title of any other than him that had a former Right: for he hath a poſſeſſion by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Will of God, which permiſſion how long it will laſt, no man ordinarily knows; every man is to preſerve his own life for the ſervice of God, and of his King or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and is ſo far to obey an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, as may tend not onely to the preſervation of his King and Father, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper himſelf, when probably he may he thereby preſerved to the correction or mercy of his true Superiour. And though by humane Law a long Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption may take away a Right, yet divine Right never dies, nor can be loſt or taken away.</hi> The ſame he ſays <hi>p.</hi> 70. <hi>That in Grants and Gifts that have their original from God or Nature (as the power of the Father hath) no inferiour power of man can limit nor make any Preſcription againſt them. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ground is built that Maxime, That</hi> Nullum tempus occurrit Regi, <hi>no time bars a King.</hi> Which ſecond aſſumption is likewiſe falſe: for I have already proved that all Fatherly power ceaſes with the life of the Father, as Motherly power with the life of the Mother; or elſe in the ſtate of Nature a man muſt be left like other Cattle, to be pickt up and markt by whoever can firſt ſeize him. And ſecondly, that it is falſe that this power and authority of a Father can be transferred to, or uſurped by another; or that the Son owes the perſon to whom his Father transfers or ſells him, any other duty than as his Aſſignee performs the Office of a Father towards him. Much leſs that an Uſurper acquires any Right over the perſon of the Son in the ſtate of Nature: for otherwiſe if a Thief ſhould
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50833:36"/> procure ſtrength enough to drive a Maſter of a ſeparate Family out of doors, and ſo this Rogue could ſubdue the whole Houſe, and ſet up for Lord and Maſter of it, that then the Wife, and Children, and Servants, were immediately bound to obey him, becauſe he hath a poſſeſſion, and is in by the permiſſive Will of God, and ſo hath a better Right than any body elſe, but the Maſter himſelf. It is true indeed, in this caſe every Member of this Family is bound to preſerve his own life, and may yield a paſſive Obedience to this Rogue, for fear of his power, and as far as he thinks it will conduce to his preſervation; but I do not ſee any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he hath from Conſcience or Reaſon, to obey this Robber farther than as he cannot help it, but may take the firſt opportunity to drive him out of the Houſe, and call in his true Father or Maſter; unleſs he hath made him any promiſe to be quiet and not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him, for then he is in the ſame ſtate with a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner upon parol: for all Writers on this ſubject, hold that nothing but a lawful War can give any man a Right over the perſon of another, unleſs he become his Servant by ſome voluntary act of his own; or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Slaves taken by the <hi>Argter</hi>-Pyrates were in a ſad caſe, for they were bound in Conſcience never to eſcape, without the conſent of their Maſters. Nor upon the Authors principles, is there any difference between a Father of a Family, in the ſtate of Nature, and a Prince, ſince he tells us more than once, that a Kingdom is but a large Family: And conſequently no difference between an Uſurper of the Fatherly power, and that of a Monarch; onely the Rogue that uſurped the one, could call himſelf but Maſter of the Family; but the other would ſtile himſelf King, Emperour, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Protector. Nor will the place of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 1. oblige any man in this caſe: for though it is ſaid, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, <hi>Nero</hi> an Uſurper being
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50833:36"/> Emperour of <hi>Rome;</hi> I deny that <hi>Nero</hi> was an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for though it is true that <hi>Claudius</hi> left a Son, yet ſince by the Roman Law a man might make whom he pleaſed his Son by Adoption, which Son ſo adopted was in all reſpects looked upon as the true Heir of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopting Father, and <hi>Nero</hi> was ſo adopted by <hi>Claudius;</hi> and ſo being elder than his own Son <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus,</hi> would ſucceed before him. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tacit</hi> Annal. 12. c. 25, 26.</note> And beſides, the Adoption being confirmed and paſſed into a Law by the Senate, <hi>Nero</hi> was as truly <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Son by the Roman Law, as <hi>Britannicus</hi> himſelf. So that an Uſurper hath at firſt no better Right than another: For Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a wicked act to be done, as a Banditi or Pyrate to take a man Priſoner, does not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on this Thief or Pyrate any Right over a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So that the inſtance the Author gives, <hi>p.</hi> 73. will not hold, <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers have ſuch a qualified Right to govern, as is in Thieves who have ſtolen Goods, and during the time they are poſſeſſed of them, have a Title in Law againſt all others but the true Owners; and ſo ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, to divers intents and purpoſes, may be obeyed:</hi> For firſt, this is no Law of Nature or Reaſon, but onely a poſitive Law of <hi>England;</hi> where, for the avoiding of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual violence and ſtrife, and for the better ſecuring of Property, they have made poſſeſſion even in Thieves to confer a Temporary Right againſt all but the true Proprietor: Whereas in the ſtate of Nature, a Thief by invading another mans Goods unjuſtly, and taking them away by violence, becomes an Enemy to all Mankind; and ſo may lawfully be killed, or have what he hath ſo poſſeſſed taken from him by any other. Secondly, Neither does the parallel between the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Goods, and that of a Kingdom, hold: for Goods may be poſſeſſed by the firſt Occupant; but Government, which is an Authority over the perſon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50833:37"/> of a man can never be ſeized, ſince a man without his own act or conſent can never lawfully fall into the power or poſſeſſion of another (as I have already proved:) So that I know not to what purpoſe this Treatiſe of the Authors could ſerve, but to make all men obliged in Conſcience to yield not onely a paſſive but an active Obedience to all the Commands of <hi>Cromwel</hi> and the <hi>Rump,</hi> not onely in things lawful and neceſſary, but indifferent ones too, <hi>p.</hi> 74. in which conſiſts all Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſince all the Authority, even of lawful Powers, extends onely to indifferent things; all other actions being ſufficiently ſetled by the Law of God or Nature.</p>
               <p>But the Author perceiving this difficulty, endeavours to extricate himſelf, by ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 75. <hi>That though granting in things indifferent, an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper may be obeyed as well as a lawful Prince, yet that it does not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that there is as much Obedience due to an uſurped Power as a lawful; but that herein lieth a main diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, that ſome things are indifferent for a lawful Superiour, which are not indifferent but unlawful for an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper to enjoyn. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation is the reſiſting and taking away the Power from him who had ſuch a former Right to govern the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, as cannot lawfully be taken away. So that it cannot be juſt for an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper to take advantage of his own unlawful act, or create himſelf a Title by continuation of his own Injuſtice. And if it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> never be an act indifferent for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper to diſobey his lawful Soveraign, much leſs can it be indifferent for him to command another to do that to which he hath no Right himſelf. It is onely then a matter indifferent for an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper to command another when the actions enjoyned are ſuch as the lawful Superiour is commanded by the Law of God to provide for the benefit of his Subjects, by the ſame or the like reſtrictions of ſuch indifferent things; and it is to be preſumed, if he had not been hindered, would have commanded the ſame or the like Laws.</hi>

               <p>Let us now ſee how far this diſtinction will ſerve his turn. I ſhould in the firſt place be glad to know what he means by theſe words, <hi>lawful Soveraign or Superiour:</hi> If he means ſuch a Superiour who was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly appointed by God, God never ſince <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſly appointed a King in any Nation. Secondly, If one who was elected by the People, or whoſe poſſeſſion is confirmed by their acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment publickly declared, and ſo paſſed into a Law; this were to ſet up what he ſo much abhors, an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive King, who muſt claim by Law. If by <hi>lawful,</hi> he means ſuch a one who upon a bare poſſeſſion, hath by his own power alone made a Law declaring himſelf to be the lawful Superiour; <hi>this Law is unlawful for him to make, or for the Subjects to obey:</hi> And if it be ſuch a one to whom poſſeſſion gave a Right (as he will have it) being in poſſeſſion by the permiſſive Will of God, though at firſt an Uſurper; Why hath not this ſecond Uſurper as good a Title to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the former, as he or his Anceſtors had to take it from him that had it before? But indeed Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupancy onely confers a Right in the ſtate of Nature to ſuch things as are meerly neceſſary for a mans ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; but Government is an Office of Truſt and Power, and which the Uſurper might very well have lived without: And why ſhould a bare poſſeſſion of this, though of three or four hundred years, confer a better Right than that of a year or two? for this laſt poſſeſſion ſeems, according to the Authors principles, to be the better Title. For he ſays, a little before, <hi>p.</hi> 69. That the firſt Uſurper hath the beſt Title, being now in by the permiſſive Will of God: And if ſo, may not the laſt Uſurper uſe the like Argument, ſince he tells us, p. 67. <hi>That this laſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper hath a better Title than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, except him who had a former Right; for he hath a poſſeſſion by the permiſſive Will of God: which permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50833:38"/> how long it may endure, no man ordinarily knows?</hi> Now which is beſt, a Right which once a man onely had by the permiſſive Will of God, but is now ended (God having otherwiſe declared himſelf,) or a preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which he hath by the ſame permiſſive Will; which when it will have an end, no body knows? But if he anſwers, as he does, <hi>p.</hi> 69. <hi>That this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper is onely then to be obeyed and reputed by the Subjects for the true Heir, where he hath continued ſo long that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the right Heir is loſt by all the Subjects; for no man hath an infallible certainty, but only a moral knowledge, which is no other than a probable Perſwaſion grounded on a peaceable Poſſeſſion; which is a Warrant for Subjection to Parents and Governours:</hi> I know not what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor means here by <hi>true Heir,</hi> and as little when he will have this knowledge to be loſt. If he means by <hi>right Heir,</hi> the Son or deſcendant of the firſt Uſurper, I ſhould be glad to know how he that had no Right himſelf, could confer a Title upon another; or by what Law his Son had a Right to ſucceed him? If by the conſent of the People, this were to grant that which he before denies as at all neceſſary to any Princes Title. If becauſe he or his Deſcendants have an uninterrupted long poſſeſſion, the difficulty ſtill remains, how this long poſſeſſion can confer a Right, for the Reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given. But if it be ſaid that the Heir of this Uſurper hath a better Right than any body elſe, as having poſſeſſion, and that it were deſtructive to the Peace of the Commonwealth to put him out, after ſo long an enjoyment of the Crown: it's true, this were a good Argument not to make any alteration in the Government, as it is ſetled; but they muſt likewiſe conſider, that the ſame may be as well made uſe of by the laſt Uſurper and his Party, ſince he having now the poſſeſſion in as full a manner as he that had it before, cannot perhaps be put out of it, without involving the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50833:38"/> Nation in a tedious bloudy War. It is likewiſe as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, when the knowledge of this right Heir of the firſt Uſurper ſhall be ſaid to be loſt by all the Subjects. If he means perſonal knowledge, when all the people that could remember the Prince that was turned out are dead, and none left alive that certainly know who is his next Heir, the Right of this true Heir will quickly be loſt in one Generation: but if he means a traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal moral knowledge (as he ſeems to do) then this can never be loſt as long as there is any Authentick or Hiſtorical Tradition of the Deſcent of this Heir; which Tradition may be continued for a thouſand years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: during all which time, the Princes that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed being Heirs of ſuch Uſurpers, can never require a perfect Right to their Crowns, the Author holding it an undoubted truth, <hi>p.</hi> 60. <hi>That though Preſcription may take away a common Right, yet divine Right (or that to a Crown) never dies, or can be taken away thereby. And upon this ground the common Maxime is built,</hi> Nullum tempus occurrit Regi. <hi>So that as long as this kind of moral knowledge of this right Heir can be had from any Authentick Hiſtory or Record, the Prince in being hath onely a Right from Poſſeſſion, and can never create himſelf a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by the continuation of his own Injuſtice, or command any of his Subjects to fight againſt this true Heir, ſince they are to obey this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> (p. 72.) <hi>or his Heirs, onely in ſuch things as tend to their own preſervation, and not to the deſtruction of the true Governour.</hi> By which Principle, the Author at once renders the Titles of all the Crowns in <hi>Europe</hi> diſputable, and all Allegiance uncertain and queſtionable by their Subjects; as I ſhall ſhew in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances, as I ſhall prove from Hiſtories of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable credit. I ſhall begin with our own Country, <hi>England.</hi> If therefore, as the Author will have it, <hi>p.</hi> 69. the Uſurper is onely then to be taken for the true Heir, when the knowledge of the right Heir is loſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50833:39"/> by all the Subjects; it will follow, that all the Kings and Queens that reigned in <hi>England</hi> until the coming in of K. <hi>James,</hi> were Uſurpers: for the Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> could not be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Conqueſt alone. (And I ſuppoſe this Authour does not allow it to be bequeathable by Will) as long as the right Heir was in being, and could be known from authentick Hiſtories and Traditions. Now the Right of the Crown by Deſcent belonging, after the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, to <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> his Couſen; he dying without Iſſue, the Right fell to <hi>Mawd</hi> his Siſter, who married <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi> III, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Buchanan de Rebus Scoticus,</hi> lib. 7.</note> King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and though her Daughter <hi>Mawd</hi> was married to <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>England,</hi> from whom all our Kings are deſcended, yet the Right was not in her, but in <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> her Brother, from whom all the Kings of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to King <hi>James</hi> were deſcended. It is true, the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were too wiſe ever to ſet up this Title, becauſe they knew the <hi>Norman</hi> Race were quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed of the Throne, and had been admitted and confirmed for lawful Kings by many great Councils or Aſſemblies of the Clergy, Nobility, and People: yet did not this abſolve the People, who might very well retain the traditional knowledge of this right Heir; <hi>For divine Right never dies, nor can be loſt or taken away, or barr'd by Preſcription.</hi> So that all Laws which were made to confirm the Crown either to <hi>Henry</hi> I. or any of his Deſcendants, were abſolutely void and unlawful, by our Authors principles; and ſo likewiſe all Wars made againſt the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> in perſon, were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſinful and unlawful, ſince (according to this Authors principle) the command of an Uſurper is not to be obeyed in any thing tending to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the perſon of the true Governour. So by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50833:39"/> the ſame Principle, all Laws made in <hi>France</hi> about the Succeſſion of the Crown, are abſolutely void: and it would be a mortal ſin in the French Nation to reſiſt any King of <hi>England</hi> of this Line, if he ſhould make War in perſon upon the French King then in being, ſince according to the ancient Laws of Deſcent in that Kingdom, he is true Heir of the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Nor can the <hi>French</hi> here plead ignorance, ſince there is ſcarce a Peaſant there but knows our King ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King of <hi>France,</hi> and quarters the Arms of that Kingdom; and ſo ought to underſtand the juſtneſs of his Title.

Nor can thoſe of this Author's opinion plead poſſeſſion, or the ſeveral Laws that have been made to confirm the Crown to the firſt Uſurpers and their Deſcendants: for it will be replied out of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>p.</hi> 70. <hi>That the right Heir having the Fatherly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in him, and ſo having his Authority from God, no infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power can make any Law of Preſcription againſt him, and</hi> Nullum tempus ocurrit Regi: And this were to make the Crown elective and diſpoſable according to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50833:40"/> the Will of the Eſtates or People. I ſhall now return to the Author's diſtinction, and ſhew that his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the Laws or Commands of Uſurpers into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different or not indifferent, ſignifies nothing: for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that an Uſurper, as ſeveral have been in <hi>England</hi> and other Kingdoms, either dares not, or thinks it not for his intereſt to alter the form of the Government, but is contented for his own ſafety to govern upon the ſame Terms his Predeceſſors did, and ſo will not raiſe any Money, or make new Laws without the conſent of the Eſtates, whom he ſummons for that purpoſe; Now they muſt either obey his Writs of Summons, or they muſt not: if they do not obey them, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be encouraged to take their Goods by force (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by a ſtanding Army which he may have ready in pay) and then ſay it is long of their own ſtubbornneſs, who would not give it him freely when they might have done it; and they ſhall likewiſe be without theſe good Laws the Author ſuppoſes he may make: but if they meet, he will not let them ſit, unleſs they firſt by ſome Oath or Recognition acknowledge his Title to be good, and own him as their lawful Prince. Now what ſhall they do in this caſe? they muſt either loſe their Liberties, and alter the form of the Government, or acknowledge him to the prejudice of their lawful Prince. But if the Laws are once made, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evidently for the good of the Commonwealth, they then are no longer indifferent, ſince all private Intereſts are to give place to the publick Good of the Commonwealth; ſince in the inſtance before given of the Father of a Family's being driven out of doors by a Robber, no doubt but every Member of the Family ought to obey this Rogue in caſe the houſe ſhould be on fire or ready to fall, and he would take upon him to give orders for the quenching or ſecuring it from falling; for they did this not to own his Authority,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50833:40"/> but from the obligation they owe to their Father or Maſter, who would have done the ſame, had he been at home. So to obey Laws made by an Uſurper that tend to the apparent benefit of the Commonwealth, is not to acknowledge theſe uſurped Powers as lawful. I do leſs underſtand the force of another diſtinction he makes uſe of, <hi>p.</hi> 155. <hi>That an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper is ſo far to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, as may tend to the preſervation of a mans King and Father, nay ſometimes even to the preſervation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per himſelf; when probably he may thereby be reſerved to the correction or mercy of his true Superiour.</hi> For how Obedience to an Uſurper can tend to the preſervation of the lawful Prince, I underſtand not. And as for the other inſtance of preſerving the perſon of the Uſurper for the mercy or correction of the true Superiour, it had been a very good pretence for Obedience to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> and the <hi>Rump;</hi> nay, to fight for them, ſince this was but to preſerve them for his Majeſties mercy or correction another time, though their Power might have continued until now; <hi>ſince they had a Poſſeſſion by the permiſſive Will of God, which how long it would endure, no body could tell.</hi> Such untoward things are Arguments drawn from falſe Principles, that they flie in the faces of thoſe that make uſe of them, and will either reduce them to abſurdities, or elſe prove weapons againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall now come to his laſt Refuge, when he can no longer evade, but that by the Peoples ignorance of <hi>Adam</hi>'s right Heir, or of the Heirs to the laſt Prince, the ſupreme Power is devolved upon the People, who may chuſe what kind of Government they pleaſe, (<hi>Patriarch.</hi> p. 21.) This he denies, ſaying, [<hi>That in ſuch caſes the Kingly Power eſcheats to the Fathers or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Heads of Families.</hi> The ſame Anſwer he gives to this Objection in his <hi>Anarchy of a limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> p. 272. where he replies (very pleaſantly)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50833:41"/> 
                  <hi>That no King can die without an Heir, as long as there is one man living in the world; it may be the Heir may be unknown to the People, but that is no fault in Nature, but the negligence of the People whom it concerns.</hi>] So that it ſeems the next Heir being often not to be known, any man, when the Prince dies, may ſtep into the Throne; and if he have Power enough, is next Heir: for a King can never die without an Heir, as long as any one man is left alive in the world; and who can diſprove him that he is not the man? So that the power he hath given to his Maſters of Families to chuſe an Heir, or one to eaſe them of their Fatherly Power, ſignifies nothing: For this Uſurper that can firſt ſeize it, may be right Heir to <hi>Adam</hi> for ought any body knows. And certainly having Poſſeſſion, which is the permiſſive will of God, he hath a better Right than any other, as we have often heard before: And are told farther in the <hi>Anarchy of a limited Monarchy,</hi> p. 273. <hi>That if the true Heir of the Crown come to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed, in ſuch caſes the Subjects Obedience to the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power muſt go along and wait upon Gods Providence; who onely hath Right to give and take away Kingdoms, and thereby adopt Subjects into the Obedience of another Fatherly Power.</hi> So that Man is not onely a Creature who is his Goods that can firſt catch him, but, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Author, is in a worſe condition than Brutes: for whereas if a Dog be taken up by a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and a Collar clapt about his neck, and ſo led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it is left to <hi>Jowler</hi>'s diſcretion how far he will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his new Maſter; and as he may either ſtay with him, if he likes his Quarters, &amp; finds himſelf well uſed, ſo ſurely he may without any ſin, knaw his halter (nay bite the fingers of this Uſurper of his Liberty) and run away. But poor Man does not onely fall to the firſt Occupant, whom he may not either obey or diſobey, as he finds it moſt conduce to his intereſt and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50833:41"/> but is peg'd down to an abſolute Obedience, and obliged in Conſcience to obey this Uſurper (let him uſe him well or ill) with the ſame reſpect and duty as if he were his Father: Which I think God was a better friend to Mankind than ever to intend. But to return to the ſubject from whence we digreſſed, our Author, for fear he ſhould ſeem by admiſſion of a Power in Fathers of Families to chuſe a Head or Prince over them, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anarchy of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy,</hi> p. 272.</note> and to have granted it to them as the whole People, he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, ſaying, <hi>It does not eſcheat to the whole People, but onely to the ſupream Heads and Fathers of Families; not as they are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but</hi> quatenus <hi>Fathers of the People, over whom they have a ſupreaem Power devolved unto them after the death of their Soveraign. Chief Fathers in Scripture are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted all the People, as all the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>as all the Congregation, as the Text plainly expounds it ſelf,</hi> 2 Chron. 1.2. <hi>where</hi> Solomon <hi>ſpeaks to all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that is, to the Captains, the Judges, and to every Governour, the</hi> chief of the Fathers; <hi>and ſo the Elders of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be the Chief of the Fathers of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, 1 King. 8.1. <hi>and</hi> 2 Chron. 5.2.</p>
               <p>By all which it appears, that the Author allows in this caſe the Government eſcheats to part, but not to all the People, or whole multitude of Men, Women, and Children taken together, to chuſe what Government they pleaſe. And indeed in this ſence there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Democracy or Government of the People in nature: for though a Democracy may be defined to be that kind of Government where the ſupream Power is in a Council or Aſſembly conſiſting of all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: And although it does not leſs concern the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children in that kind of Government to be happier than in others, yet who ever thought it a new ſort of Commonwealth, and not a perfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50833:42"/> though Women, Children, and Slaves were excluded the publick Councils and Aſſemblies? And therefore if it be eſteemed a perfect Democracy (and was ſo at <hi>Athens,</hi> which all muſt grant to have been ſo) where onely Free men, or at their own diſpoſe, and ſuch who were ſuppoſed at firſt to have by their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together inſtituted this Government, which is likewiſe continued by thoſe who have ſucceeded into their Places and Rights: I ſee no reaſon why theſe ſhould not be looked upon as repreſenting the whole promiſcuous body of the People, to whom the Power devolves upon the want of a Succeſſour. For it is likely that Commonwealths were firſt inſtituted by Fathers of Families, having Wives, Children, and Slaves under their Domeſtick Government; whom nevertheleſs they would neither equal with themſelves, by admitting them to a Vote in the Government, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet would abdicate their power over them. But then the Author urges, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anarchy of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy,</hi> p. 270, 271.</note> 
                  <hi>If Infants and Children be concluded by the Votes of their Parents, this deſtroys the whole Cauſe: for if it be allowed that the Acts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents bind their Children, then farewel the Doctrine of the natural freedom of Mankind. Where ſubjection of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Parents is natural, there can be no natural freedom: and if any reply, that all Children ſhall not be bound by their Parents conſents, but onely thoſe that are under age; it muſt be conſidered, that in Nature there is no Nonage. If a man be not born free, ſhe doth not aſſigne him any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there time when he ſhall attain his freedom: or if ſhe did, then Children attaining that age, ſhould be diſcharged of their Parents contract. So that in concluſion, if it be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined that the People were but once free from ſubjection by Nature, it will prove a meer impoſſibility ever lawfully to introduce any kind of Government whatſoever, without apparent wrong to a multitude of People. It is farther
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50833:42"/> obſervable, that ordinarily Children and Servants are a far greater number than Parents and Maſters; and for the major part of theſe to be able to vote and appoint what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Governours their Fathers and Maſters ſhall be ſubject to, is moſt unnatural, and in effect to give the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the government over their Parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Objection I reply, 1. That the Author is here miſtaken, and that there is really an Age of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in nature (as hath been already proved) in which though the Child be indeed free, yet (by reaſon of his own want of ſtrength and diſcretion to judge what is neceſſary for his own good and preſervation) is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſubmit himſelf to his Parents judgment in all things conducing to that end. 2. That Children, neither Infants or others, are obliged to the Acts or Agreements of their Anceſtors in the ſtate of Nature, farther than it conduces to their benefit or preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that if a married man out of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ſhould ſell or yield himſelf to a Maſter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily for a Slave, upon condition that his Maſter ſhould provide him all the neceſſaries of life (without which ſuch a grant or ſale of a mans ſelf cannot be ſuppoſed good) certainly if he had then no Children, this could not bind his Iſſue that was to be born, ſo that they ſhould be perpetual Slaves to all Generations; ſince natural Equity, and the favour of Liberty, will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, that the Aliment which the Maſter affords the Children of this Slave, are underſtood to be contained under that proviſion which the Maſter is obliged to make for him and his, by vertue of their Contract. Or admit that there was no expreſs proviſion made in the Conditions for the maintenance of the Children, yet in this caſe, I ſee no Right the Maſter can claim in the perſons of theſe Children, longer than 'till he hath ſatisfied himſelf out of their labour for the charges he hath been at in feeding and providing for them;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50833:43"/> which may very well be by twenty five years of age (as I have already proved.) So that about that time I ſee no reaſon why ſuch Children may not lawfully ſhift for themſelves, if they do not like their Maſter. And if any Friend of theirs undertake to ſatisfie their Maſter before that time, I think they are free, though he ſhould refuſe to accept it, ſince it was lawfully ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Indeed for Slaves taken in a juſt War, there may be ſome appearance of reaſon, why their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould alſo be Slaves, ſince the Parents accepted of their lives upon that condition that they ſhould live in perpetual ſervitude, and their Maſter undertook to maintain them upon no other conſideration: So that theſe Children do implicitely owe their lives to their Maſter, ſince he might by the Laws of War have ſlain their Parents, and ſo they could never have been born. But I will not aſſert, that even this ſlavery is perpetual in relation to the Children: But as for Subjects, though they are not directly or expreſly bound by the Acts or Conſents of their Anceſtors, who firſt inſtituted the Government, yet indirectly or conſequentially they are obliged to ſtand to what their Anceſtors have done; For ſince, as I ſaid before, no man will deny to accept of the Promiſe or Conditions of his Anceſtor, if it be for his advantage, and ſince the Inſtitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was for the common good of mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; ſo this or that particular Government being for the preſervation and ſecurity of every Subject that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys the priviledges thereof, no man can believe that the Poſterity of thoſe that firſt inſtituted this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will go about to undo what their Anceſtors have done ſo much for their benefit, and reduce all things to the ſtate of Nature again. So that as long as they ſubmit to, and enjoy the benefits of the Government which was firſt eſtabliſht by the conſent of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, they are ſuppoſed to yield a tacite Aſſent to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50833:43"/> thoſe Compacts which they long ſince made, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely become Subjects to that Government under which they were born. So that thoſe that firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Government in any Country, have no neceſſity expreſly to promiſe or engage for the Subjection and Obedience of their Children, or thoſe who ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them. And if any private perſons will not own this Government, and ſo take upon to reſiſt it, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are not obliged by the Compacts of their Forefathers to obey it as eſtabliſhed by them; ſuch perſons, if they enter into a ſtate of War, or make Confederacies to that end, may juſtly be looked upon as Enemies to the Government, and puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, ſince they will go about to diſturb the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peace and Tranquility of the Nation for their own private Diſcontents or Advantage: for the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once entred into Society, can never be ſuppoſed to alter their Judgments all at once without very good cauſe, much leſs to die, though the particular perſons that conſtituted it do: for as a River is ſtill eſteemed the ſame as long as the water runs in the ſame Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, though the ſame individual water never ſtays in the ſame place, but one part ſtill puſhes out another; ſo thoſe are not leſs to be eſteemed in the politick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity (of a Civil State) the ſame people, than thoſe by whom the Commonwealth was at firſt founded. And though it is true that Governments may have been at firſt begun by Fathers of Families and other Freemen, who firſt ſubmitted their Wills to that of one perſon or more, and ſo the Women, Children, and Servants, who had had no Votes in its Inſtitution, might be ſuppoſed as repreſented by their Husbands, Fathers, and Maſters: And ſince they enjoy all the common benefits of the Commonwealth, and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe capable of enjoying all thoſe priviledges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which are proper and peculiar to Free Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50833:44"/> whenever they come to be at their own diſpoſal, and that they owe their breeding up and preſervation to its protection; they may well be lookt upon as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an higher Obligation in Conſcience and Gratitude to this Government, than Strangers of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who onely ſtaying there for a time to purſue their own Occaſions, and having no Right to the ſame priviledges and advantages of the Commonwealth, do onely owe a paſſive obedience to its Laws.</p>
               <p>But to let you ſee more plainly, that upon ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the Government as the Author grants, not onely the Maſters of Families, as Fathers, ought to have Votes, but all others that are at their own diſpoſe; I will ask any of his opinion, what he thinks of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man living in a houſe alone, or with a Wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Children or Servants, or perhaps boarding in another mans houſe for their money, why they ſhould not have Votes as well as thoſe that are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant Fathers and Maſters? I can ſee no reaſon, nor I believe they neither. So though the Author by the words <hi>Supream and Independant Heads of Families,</hi> ſeems to exclude all Sons from having Votes whilſt their Fathers are alive, although they are married, and have ſeparated into diſtinct Families; yet ſince I have proved that neither Paternal Authority nor Filial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is abſolute or perpetual in the ſtate of Nature (into which the Commonwealth is by the death of the Prince now ſuppoſed to be reſolved) and if it were otherwiſe, yet unleſs they will void all thoſe Laws and Conſtitutions that have been before ſettled both for deſcent of Inheritances, and the diſtinguiſhing of Property. So that if theſe Laws ſtand in force during this <hi>interregnum</hi> (unleſs they will fall to abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion) theſe Sons ſo making divers Families, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Eſtates diſtinct from their Fathers, ought likewiſe to have Votes in the Government, upon the Authours
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50833:44"/> own principles, ſince the Laws of the Country have ſet them free from all Paternal ſubjection, more than what the Rules of Piety and Gratitude oblige them to. And as for ſuch Sons as (though of mature age, yet) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as Servants in their Fathers Families, and ſo are under a greater ſubjection than thoſe that are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it; I ſee no reaſon why they may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their Father, as him they could beſt truſt, to vote for them, and repreſent them in the choice of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; and then they are as much obliged as any man can be by the act of a perſon whom he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to act for him, or as theſe Fathers of Families would be by Repreſentatives of their own chuſing: it being morally impoſſible, if this devolution of the Government ſhould happen in a populous Country, for all the Authors independent Heads or Fathers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ever to meet in Perſon to chuſe a King; theſe being vaſtly numerous, and divided from each other at great diſtances. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anarchy of a mixt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</hi> p. 269</note> So that all the Author's Objections againſt a mixt Popular Election will prove as ſtrong againſt this of Fathers alone: For how, except by ſome ſecret miraculous inſtinct, ſhould they all meet at one time and place? What one Head of a Family or Company, leſs than the whole Body of theſe Fathers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, can have power to appoint either time or place of Election, where they are all free and independant by Nature? and without a lawful Summons, it is moſt unjuſt to binde thoſe that are abſent. So neither can the whole Body of the Fathers of Families ſummon it ſelf: One man is ſick, another is lame, a third is aged, and a fourth (though a Father of a Family, may be under years of diſcretion, or not in his right ſenſes) and many more may have buſineſs of their own which they cannot leave, to run two or three hundred miles up to the chief City to chuſe a King. So that either the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50833:45"/> People may elect, or elſe his Fathers of Families can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, for the ſame reaſons. And if the major part of theſe Fathers ſhould agree to chuſe Repreſentatives, how can this Agreement of the major part bind the minor that did not conſent, <note place="margin">Patriarcha, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. <hi>Where the Arguments againſt Elections by a major part, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at large.</hi>
                  </note> ſince according to the Authors principles, in Aſſemblies that take their original from the Law of Nature, no one man or multitude can give away the Right of another? So that though the Author ſeems to have been ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured as to have given theſe independent Fathers of Families a Power in this caſe of Eſcheat to chuſe a Governour, yet all this ſignifies nothing, ſince they can never all meet or agree to chuſe Repreſentatives: They are ſtill like to be his Slaves who can make a Party ſtrong enough to ſeize the Government, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp an Authority over them: <hi>Whom yet they muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, ſince he either is or repreſents the right Heir of</hi> Adam; <hi>and ſo no body hath a better Right than himſelf, who is in by the permiſſive Will of God; which how long it will laſt, no body can tell. And God does but adopt Subjects into the obedience of another Fatherly Power, or elſe they muſt fall into a down-right Anarchy, and every Father of a Family may ſet up for an abſolute Prince.</hi> But to return whither we have digreſſed; for I have ſaid this, onely to ſhew that this Authors principles (as well as thoſe of others) contradict themſelves in this ſubject; and either theſe Fathers of Families are the People, and conſequently cannot, according to this Authour, ever meet or agree to chuſe a Prince; or elſe the whole People may as well. But ſince it may be objected, that it does not ſerve to find out truth, or ſettle the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in hand, barely to recriminate and ſhew the ſame flaws in his Principles as he finds in thoſe of others; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> p. 41.</note> let us ſee if his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50833:45"/> againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> and all thoſe who place Supream Power in the People, be ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things, that the poor Jeſuits are abſolutely run down in this Diſpute. He therefore firſt asks, <hi>If their meaning be, that there is but one and the ſame Power in all the People of the World, ſo that no Power can be granted, except all the men upon the Earth meet and agree to chuſe a Governour?</hi> To which <hi>Suarez</hi> anſwers, <hi>That it is ſcarce poſſible, nor yet expedient, that all the men in the world ſhould be gathered together into one Community. It is likelier that either never, or for a very ſhort time, this Power was in this manner in the whole Multitude of men collected together; but a little after the Creation men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be divided into ſeveral Commonwealths, and this diſtinct Power was in each of them.</hi> To which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor replies, <hi>That this Anſwer of ſcarce poſſible, nor yet expedient,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>begets a new doubt how this diſtinct Power comes to each particular Community, when God gave it to the whole Multitude onely, and not to any particular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. Can they ſhew or prove, that ever the whole Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude met, and divided this Power which God gave them in groſs, by breaking it into parcels, and by appointing a diſtinct Power to each Commonwealth? Without ſuch a Compact, I cannot ſee (according to their own Principles) how there can be an Election of a Magiſtrate in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but a meer <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation upon the Priviledge of the World. If any think that particular Multitudes at their own diſcretion had power to divide themſelves into ſeveral Commonwealths, thoſe that think ſo, have neither Reaſon nor Proof for ſo thinking: and thereby a Gap is opened for every petty factious Multitude to make more Commonwealths than there be Families in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which Diſpute I conceive the Jeſuit hath gone too far, in aſſerting an undivided Soveraignty in the whole Multitude collected together before any Civil Government inſtituted; That being onely the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50833:46"/> or Agreement of thoſe that entred into it, and binding none elſe at firſt. So likewiſe this is a meer <hi>Chimera</hi> of the Author's, that <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah</hi> were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchs and Heirs of the World, ſo that no man could withdraw themſelves from the Obedience of their right Heirs, without being guilty of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Whereas I have already proved, that all the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and their Deſcendants, were independant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of their Families, without any ſubordination to the eldeſt Son or Heir. And if every Brother had a Right to ſet up an Independant Family or Principality diſtinct from that of the eldeſt, I would fain know what became of this abſolute Right of <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> and by what authority this undivided Soveraignty which God had conferred on <hi>Noah,</hi> was thus crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into parcels. If by Gods appointment, then it ſeems God did not countenance this notion of the right Heir of the world: If they did it of their own heads, then all the ancient Patriarchs, or firſt Peoplers of the world, were guilty of Rebellion and Uſurpation againſt their elder Brother and his Deſcendants. But if the Author's Friends think he hath the advantage, becauſe I grant that the World was peopled after the Flood under the conduct or government of diſtinct Heads or Fathers of Families; this does not grant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny natural Right in thoſe Heads of Families to have an abſolute power over their Deſcendants, ſince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps God divided the Language of the World by ſo many Tribes or Families, for the better conſervation of the mutual Love and Concord of neer Relations, ſince men would more readily obey their Anceſtor or common Father, than a meer ſtranger; or for other reaſons beſt known to his infinite Wiſdom. So that there was a neceſſity that thoſe of the ſame Stock ſhould upon the diſperſion march off together, ſince none elſe underſtood one another. Yet the Scripture does not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50833:46"/> tell us whether in this diviſion and plantation of the World, the Headſhip of theſe Families was according to elderſhip of birth, or whether they elected the fitteſt man of their Tribe or Family to be their Leader: And if the eldeſt were the man, it was not from any Right over them, but either of reverence to his Wiſdom, or to avoid the Diſſentions that might ariſe by other kind of choice on Elderſhip; though indeed it confers no Right of it ſelf, yet is often preferred as a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Lot. So that every one of theſe Heads of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies being independant from each other, they could never agree upon a Ruler over them, but by Compact among themſelves: And if ſo, he was their Leader that all the reſt liked and agreed upon. So that there needed no Compact of all the People of the world, ſince every Father of a Family being independant upon any man elſe, had a power to confer his Authority of governing himſelf and his Family upon whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: which Power, whether, and how far it was from God, and what kind of Authority it was, we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine hereafter. So that though I grant all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be at firſt inſtituted by Fathers of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, yet this does not prove any deſpotick Power that ſuch Fathers had over their Children or Deſcendants; and ſo conſequently could confer no ſuch Authority over them. So that all the reſt of the Authors Queries about the diſtinct power of the Multitude vaniſh, ſince though there never was any Government where all the promiſcuous Rabble of Women and Children had Votes, as being not capable of it, yet it does not for all that prove all legal. Civil Government does not owe his Original to the conſent of the People, ſince the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families, or Freemen at their own diſpoſe, were really and indeed all the People that needed to have Votes; ſince Women, as being concluded by their Husbands, and being commonly unfit for civil
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50833:47"/> buſineſs, and Children in their Fathers Families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the notion of Servants, and without any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in Goods or Land, had no reaſon to have Votes in the Inſtitution of the Government.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe all the Authors Objections and Cavils, <hi>p.</hi> 44. how the greater part of a Multitude could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the reſt in the ſtate of Nature, ſignifie nothing; ſince if many men meet to chuſe a Governour, the firſt Queſtion muſt be, whether the Votes of the major part ſhall not conclude the reſt; and then all that agree that they ſhall, are bound by their own conſent; and thoſe that will not agree to it, are ſtill in the ſtate of Nature toward all the reſt, and are free to go and ſet up a Government by themſelves, that they all can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to <hi>Nemine Contradicente.</hi> And if they diſturb thoſe that have agreed, that they will be concluded by the majority, they may be lawfully uſed as Enemies. And for Proxies or Repreſentatives, though the beginnings of moſt Kingdoms and Commonwealths, like the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> are hard to be traced up to their Heads or Fountains, and no man can poſitively tell the manner of their beginning; yet if they began from ſome ſmall quantity of men collected into one Army or City, there needed no Proxies at all, ſince every man might give his Vote himſelf. But ſince the Author puts me to name any Commonwealth out of Hiſtory, where the Multitude, or ſo much as the greateſt part of it ever conſented, either by Voice or Proxies, to the election of a Prince; I will name him two Commonwealths: The firſt was <hi>Rome,</hi> where all the People or Freemen conſented to the election of <hi>Romulus,</hi> being formerly propoſed. See <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus,</hi> lib. 3. And the ſecond ſhall be that of <hi>Venice,</hi> where though it is true the whole promiſcuous Rabble did not chuſe a Prince, yet all the Maſters of Families, or Freemen at their own diſpoſe, had a Vote in the choice of the firſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50833:47"/> Duke and Senate; which plainly proves ſome Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to have had their beginning by the conſent of the People. And though ſome Governments have begun by Conqueſt, yet ſince thoſe Conquerours could never perform this without men over which they were not always born Monarchs, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that thoſe Souldiers or Volunteers had no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to ſerve them, but from their own agreements with their General, and for thoſe advantages he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them in the ſhare of thoſe Conqueſts they ſhould make. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Read likewiſe our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of the manner of</hi> Will. <hi>the Conquerors coming over, and you will finde thoſe that helped him in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition were Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a ſhare of his Conqueſts; which he after made good to them.</hi>
                  </note> Thus were the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> and our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kingdoms erected by ſuch Generals of Armies, who not being Kings at home, nor able to ſubſiſt there, were forced to ſeek their fortunes abroad; which when they had obtained, they could have no farther Right over the men they brought with them, than what ſprung from their mutual Compacts and Conſents. And as for Proxies, as there was no need of them in the inſtituting of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths we read of, ſince taking their Original from all the People of one City or Army, they might eaſily give their Votes themſelves; but where the People or Maſters of Families are more numerous and diſperſed than can well meet all together, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, upon the Authors Conceſſion of an Eſcheat of the Crown, that ever a new Monarch can be choſen without their making Repreſentatives. As for what he ſays about the ſilent Acceptation or tacite Conſent (or non-contradiction) of the People, no man will ſay that it alone confers a Right, where there was none before; as in the caſe of Conquerours or Uſurpers, whom perhaps People dare not ſpeak againſt: So
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50833:48"/> likewiſe a tacite Conſent to a Government, whether Paternal or Civil, juſtly inſtituted, does confer a Right, as I have already granted, and ſhall now farther ſhew in anſwer to the Authors Objections. The Author urges farther, <hi>That if Children under years of diſcretion, and Servants, are not abſolutely and in Conſcience obliged to ſubmit to the Votes of their Fathers and Maſters in the choice of the Government, farther than they receive benefit and advantage by it; then every man is at liberty that does not like the Government, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anarchy of a mixt Monarchy,</hi> p. 268.</note> to be of what Kingdom he pleaſes: and ſo every petty Company hath a Right to make a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by it ſelf; and not onely every City, but every Village, and every Family, nay, and every particular man would have a liberty to chuſe himſelf to be his own King if he pleaſed; and he were a madman, that being by Nature free, would chuſe any man but himſelf to be his Governour; and ſo no man would be tyed to obey the Government far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he found it for his intereſt and advantage, and conſequently would think he might lawfully reſiſt it when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he found it impoſe upon him what he did not like, or was contrary to his intereſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, I grant, firſt, That every Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of a propriety in Land or Goods in any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not onely bound to obey, but likewiſe to maintain it; ſince thoſe that firſt inſtituted the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, did likewiſe tye themſelves and all thoſe that ſhould at any time poſſeſs thoſe Lands or Goods, to the maintenance of the Government which they had eſtabliſht: And it is juſt and reaſonable, that thoſe that claim under ſuch firſt poſſeſſors, ſhould, if they like to enjoy the Lands or Goods, perform the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions annexed to them; ſince men may by their own private Deeds, much more by a common conſent, change their Eſtates with what Conditions they pleaſe; which thoſe that afterwards come to enjoy the ſame
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50833:48"/> under their Title, are certainly bound in Law and Conſcience to make good. Secondly, As for all others who poſſeſſing no ſhare in the Lands or Goods of a Kingdom, yet enjoy the common benefits of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I conceive they are likewiſe bound to obey and maintain it as firſt inſtituted, for the reaſons before given. So on the other ſide, if they do not like the Government they live under, the world is wide enough, and they may remove themſelves elſewhere: for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that the poſitive Laws of any Government do oblige any man in Conſcience (who is not a ſlave by his own act or fault) never to go out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where he was born, or can oblige him to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain if he once go out of it, or can hinder him from becoming a Subject to another Prince or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, unleſs he have taken an Oath of Allegiance to the Prince where he was born, and then he is tyed by his Oath not to act any thing contrary thereunto: And if one man may do this, why not more, and ſo on to an indefinite number? But if any Lawyer tells me there is a native Allegiance due by the Laws of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Countries precedent to any Oath, and that in ſome Countries (as anciently in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> at this day) there are Laws that no man ſhall travel out of the Kingdom without leave; I ſuppoſe theſe are but poſitive Laws, and as ſuch bind onely to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the puniſhment as to forfeiture of Eſtate, or the like, but do not bind the Conſcience to obſerve them farther than as it is convinced the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is more than indifferent in its own nature, and conduces to the good of Mankind in general, or of the whole Commonwealth in particular. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was this notion of a native Allegiance known to our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors, ſince they counted no man an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Subject until he was ſworn in the Tourn or Court of Frankpledge, and was entred into a decenary
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50833:49"/> or Tything. And if it be objected, that upon theſe Terms the major part of a people may go away and leave the Government without defence; that is not likely, nor ſo much as to be ſuppoſed, as long as the Country continues habitable, and the Government tolerable for the Subjects to live under: which if it prove otherwiſe, I ſee no reaſon that God ſhould have ordained any Country for a common Bridewel, where men ſhould be obliged in Conſcience to drudge, be oppreſſed, and ill-uſed all days of their lives without remedy. And as for the other part of the bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences the Author inſiſts will follow, if this natural freedom of Mankind be allow'd, for which you may conſult his <hi>Anarchy of a mixt Monarchy,</hi> where you will ſee them at large, <hi>p.</hi> 268, 269. <hi>Every petty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hath a Right to make a Kingdom by it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall anſwer him as briefly as I can. The Author diſcourſes after that rate, that one would think, if it were not for his Principle of Patriarchal Power, men could not ſubſiſt, his being the foundation of all Civil Government and Property. As for the firſt abſurdity that will follow upon the ſuppoſal of the Peoples pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>That any man might be his own King;</hi> I would ask the Author, What if any man, being weary of the world, will withdraw into ſome Deſert? I think he hath then no other Governour than <hi>Adam</hi> had: Nor is this unlawful; or elſe all the ancient Hermits, who in times of perſecution retired into Deſerts, ſinn'd in ſo doing. But for the abſurdities that follow the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of a natural ſtate of Freedom, <hi>As that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular City or Family may chuſe what Government they pleaſe, if they do not like what is already eſtabliſhed;</hi> I have already granted, that where a Commonwealth is eſtabliſhed, and men are come out of the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſtitute one Politick Body, all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it are obliged in Conſcience to maintain this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50833:49"/> Government according to its firſt Inſtitution. But if it be to be conſtituted anew, as upon <hi>his Eſcheat of the Crown among the Fathers of Families,</hi> Who are to chuſe one? who muſt take upon him this Fatherly Power over them? The inconvenience will be the ſame upon his own Principles: For all Cities, Towns, and Families con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of ſo many independant Heads of Families, if the major part of an Aſſembly cannot conclude the minor (as this Author ſuppoſes) then though all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families in a Nation ſhould agree in the choice of a King, and but thoſe of one Town or Family diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, theſe Diſſenters, if they do not like the Prince the reſt have elected, may certainly (if they are able) divide from them, and ſet up a diſtinct Government of their own; ſince all theſe Fathers of Families being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like free and independant, can in the ſtate of Nature claim no Superiority over each other. So that the Author, from his own Principles, falls into the ſame inconveniencies which he finds fault with in thoſe of others; whereas indeed there is no abſurdity in this Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now conſider in the laſt place that part of his Hypotheſis (<hi>Patriarch.</hi> p. 21.) where he ſuppoſes, <hi>That all ſuch prime Heads and Fathers of Families have power to conſent in the uniting or conferring their Fatherly Right of Soveraign Authority on whom they pleaſe; and he that is ſo elected, claims not his Power as a Donative from the People, but as being ſubſtituted properly by God, from whom he receives his Royal Charter of an univerſal Father, though teſtified by the miniſtry of the Heads of the People.</hi> I have already pull'd up the foundations of this Notion in the beginning of theſe Obſervations, by ſhewing that God hath not ordain'd or conferred any ſuch Power on any particular Father or other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and therefore neither on all the Fathers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Countries taken together, they not having any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50833:50"/> Ownerſhip or Property in their Childrens perſons, but a Right to govern and direct them for their benefit and preſervation; which Fatherly Right cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to another, much leſs ſurvive his perſon, as I have already proved. Yet to render this as clear as may be, granting him what he contends for, that this Fatherly Power may be transferred to another; I ſhould be glad to know, though the Monarch ſo nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by them may have a ſupreme Power over all their Children and Servants, yet whence does he derive this Right of commanding abſolutely over the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Eſtates of theſe Fathers of Families them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Not from ſucceſſion from <hi>Adam;</hi> for his right Heir cannot now be known: nor from their transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the power of governing their own perſons upon him; for then this Right commences from their own Act or Election, and not from the Fatherly power ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be at firſt conferred on <hi>Adam.</hi> And if they transfer onely their Fatherly or Maſterly Authority upon this new Monarch, then he hath onely a Right to govern their Children and Servants, the Perſons and Eſtates of theſe Fathers not being included in this Grant. And again, if this Election in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could confer a Right, then this Monarch muſt owe his Power to theſe Fathers of Families; and ſo theſe being (as I have already proved) the repreſentative Body of the People, he muſt receive his Authority as a Donative from them; which he will by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of. But ſince he will have him properly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſubſtituted by God, from whom he receives his Power of an univerſal Father, then theſe Fathers of Families do not create or conſtitute the Monarch, but onely are Inſtruments or Miniſters to put him in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: and if ſo, it is the poſſeſſion of the Crown, and not their Election, that gives him this Right. But (as the Author words it) <hi>He receives from God this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50833:50"/> Charter of an univerſal Father.</hi> Upon which Principle, ſee not to what purpoſe this Nomination or Election <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His firſt reaſon for it, is built upon <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Conceſſion, <hi>That God when he made all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind of one man, did ſeem openly to ſignifie, that he rather approved the government of one man than of many.</hi> This had been ſomewhat of an Argument, if <hi>Adam</hi>'s power had been purely Monarchical over <hi>Eve</hi> and all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Deſcendants, as it was not; but if it had, Gods bare Approbation lays no Obligation for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to practiſe it now, any more than it is a good Argument to ſay, that it is now not onely lawful, but neceſſary for men to marry their Siſters, becauſe God approved of that way of propagation of mankind at firſt. Secondly, <hi>God declared his Will, when he endues not onely Men, but all Creatures with a natural Propenſity to Monarchy; neither can it be doubted but a natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity is to be referred to God, who is the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> What he means by a Propenſity in all Creatures to Monarchy, I underſtand not; neither know I any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy among Brutes, beſides that of the ſtronger over the weaker; and in that Authors ſence, the maſter-Buck in a Herd of Deer, the maſter-Bull in that of Cows, and the Bell-weather of the Flock, are all of them ſo many Monarchs, endued with Fatherly Authority over the Herd; or elſe, which is as good, are Uſurpers of that Authority, and ſo the Herd are all bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſubmit to them.

But it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as great a Queſtion, whether after Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was eſtabliſhed, it was likewiſe abſolute, ſo that the King might put any body to death, right or wrong: For we find, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.45. the People reſcued <hi>Jonathan</hi> out of the hands of his Father <hi>Saul,</hi> and would not permit him to be put to death for his breach of the raſh Vow which <hi>Saul</hi> had made; nor is it imputed to the People, that is, the Army, for a ſin. Neither could <hi>Ahab</hi> take away <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard and his Life together, but by colour of Law, and a legal Tryal. Neither could King <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſave <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet from the power of the Princes who caſt him into the Dungeon: for <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold, he is in your hand; for the King is not he that can do any thing againſt you.</hi> His fourth reaſon is, that God in Scripture mentions not, nor takes notice of any other Government than Monarchical. This is but a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Argument at beſt, the Scriptures not being written to teach us Politicks, but to declare God's Will, and to ſhew us his merciful and gracious dealing with the <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithſtanding all their backſlidings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions againſt his Commandments. His fifth reaſon is, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Ethicks, chap.</hi> 11.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50833:54"/> for though a man be obliged to his own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet he himſelf is the onely Judge of the means; and if he erre, and uſe the worſt means for the beſt, they are not in fault if they acted as well as they could, and to the beſt of their knowledge, for that end. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does it follow, that there are no more ſorts of Government than theſe two to be choſen. Nor is it any better Argument, that the world for a long time knew no other ſort of Government but onely Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and that the Platforms of Commonwealths were hatched amongſt a few Cities in <hi>Greece,</hi> and that they were firſt governed by Kings, until the wantonneſs, ambition, or faction of the People made them attempt news kinds of Regiment. But let any one read the Greek Hiſtories, and he will find the cruelty and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Kings did more frequently give occaſion to the People to run into Commonwealths, than either the ambition or faction of the People. And as for the antiquity of Monarchy, the alteration of it rather makes againſt him, ſince the whole Body of a People ſeldom alter a Government, unleſs they find themſelves hurt by it, and that it proved inconvenient for them.

                  <hi>I would onely ſhew, that for theſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes the name of Dictator became hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: for all things ſeem good and profitable onely whilſt they are well uſed, which if they come to be depraved by thoſe that are in power, the ſame things are counted wicked and unprofitable.</hi> So likewiſe (<hi>p.</hi> 73.) he makes the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or People of <hi>Rome</hi> to have elected <hi>Nero, Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> for Emperours, and to have murdered <hi>Pertinax, Alexander Severus, Gordiun,</hi> and the reſt there named; whereas whoever reads the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of thoſe times, will find it was not the People
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50833:55"/> or Senate, but the Army that either elected or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Emperours: And as for <hi>Nero,</hi> the Senate had never dared to have declared him a publick Enemy, had he not become ſo odious and intolerable, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body would take Arms for him; and that the Army under <hi>Galba,</hi> which had revolted and choſen him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, was then marching to <hi>Rome.</hi> So that indeed theſe Emperours were torn in pieces by the Dogs they themſelves fed, and kept conſtantly in pay to prevent the People, who had not yet quite forgot their former Liberty, from recovering it again. And the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had juſt as great a hand in the ſetting up and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down Emperours, as thoſe of <hi>Stambola</hi> have had in the depoſing or ſetting up thoſe Grand Seigniors which the Janizaries (their Guards) have ſtrangled of late years, ſetting up their Uncles or Brothers in their rooms; or as the People of <hi>England</hi> had in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up either <hi>Oliver</hi> or his Son <hi>Richard</hi> for Protectors. But leaving theſe leſſer Miſtakes, which I look upon onely as the Tranſports of the Author's Reſentments againſt Popular Government, in which I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him in the main; onely I would fain lay the Saddle upon the right Horſe, and not blame them for the faults committed by a ſtanding Army which in thoſe times domineer'd over both Emperour and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and impoſed upon them what Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour they pleas'd, though never ſo baſe and unworthy. I ſhall therefore in the laſt place come to the ſecond point I before propoſed, whether the perſon on whom the Fathers of Families upon this Eſcheat of the Crown confers their Authority, owe the ſame to them, or elſe immediately to God. The Author (in the paſſage before cited) will by no means grant, <hi>That the perſon ſo elected claims his Power from the People, but as being ſubſtituted properly by God, from whom he receives his Royal Charter of an univerſal Father, though teſtified by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50833:55"/> the Miniſtry of the Heads of the People.</hi> Which Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is built upon grounds altogether falſe and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as I have already proved: For firſt, he here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, <hi>That God hath given by divine grant, all Fathers in the ſtate of Nature, an abſolute deſpotick power over the perſons of their Sons, ſo that they may ſell or otherwiſe transfer this Fatherly power to whom they pleaſe. And</hi> ſecondly, <hi>That the Children are as much obliged to obey thoſe to whom the Fathers transfer this Right, as they were their Fathers themſelves.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That this Power ſo transferred, does not properly derive it ſelf from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who ſo paſs over their Fatherly power, but to God, who conferred it on them at firſt.</hi> In which Hypotheſis every one of the Propoſitions are falſe: For, <hi>firſt,</hi> I have proved that no Father hath by <hi>any divine Grant or Charter,</hi> an abſolute deſpotick power over the perſon of his Son: Or, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that God hath given Fathers a power to bequeath or transfer their Authority to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſo that the Grantee ſhould by this Aſſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſucceed to all the Rights of a Father: and therefore the two former being falſe, the laſt of Princes receiving their power immediately from God, which is built upon them, muſt be ſo too. And beſides, it is evident, that theſe Fathers do not onely here paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Fatherly power of governing of their Wives and Children, but likewiſe that of governing themſelves, not as Fathers, but as men; ſince they muſt transfer this power, whether they had Wives or Children or not, elſe they might onely paſs over to this new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch their power over their Wives and Children, and reſerve the power of governing themſelves ſtill: So that it is plain, there is a power different from that of a Father, to be transferred. But if it may be replyed, They may chuſe themſelves a Father if they pleaſe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have heard of a mans adopting of a Son, which ſtill muſt be by this Son's own conſent; yet I never
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50833:56"/> heard of a Son's adopting himſelf a Father, or that a Father, which is a natural Relation, can be created at mans pleaſure: it is true, a Lord or Maſter may, but he cannot thereby challenge that natural Reverence and Gratitude due onely to a Father. So that if Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have a power of governing themſelves and their actions in the ſtate of Nature, and that they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this Right on any other, it is evident they do not confer this as a Paternal power on their Monarch, which the Author ſuppoſes to be granted by God to all Fathers.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now come to the ſecond Head at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and examine what power a Maſter of a ſeparate Family hath over his Slaves or Servants in the ſtate of Nature. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As for hired Servants, though it is true they may ſubmit themſelves to the will and diſpoſal of another what Diet they ſhall eat, and what Clothes they ſhall wear, what work they ſhall do, and what hours of reſt or ſleep they ſhall have to themſelves; and that the Maſter may beat or correct him if he do amiſs, and through wilfulneſs or negligence diſobey his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters commands; and that theſe are the Conditions that moſt hired Servants, being part of their Maſters Family, do ſerve upon: yet is this not ſo properly an abſolute Obedience, as a duty of Truth and Honeſty in the Servant; ſince as he is bound to perform his part of the Contract, ſo likewiſe is the Maſter to perform what he hath promiſed them, ſince this ſervice is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolute nor perpetual: ſo that when his time is out, he is free of courſe. And if in the mean time the Maſter does not allow him ſufficient Food, Clothes, or hours of reſt, ſo that he may be able to perform his work, this Servant in the ſtate of Nature (if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade his Maſter to uſe him better) may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt quit his ſervice as ſoon as he can; ſince he was to yield his Maſter his Labour upon certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50833:56"/> which not performed on the Maſters part, the Servant is not obliged any longer to perform his part of the Bargain, in living with him or ſerving him. And as for thoſe that have ſold or yielded themſelves up as abſolute perpetual Servants or Slaves to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of another, I ſee no reaſon why they may not in this ſtate of Nature make certain Conditions with their Maſter, before they will give themſelves up to him, ſince if a man may covenant with another upon what condition he will ſerve him for ſeven years, why may he not do the ſame for his whole life? So that upon the non-performance of theſe Conditions, this kind of Servant hath the ſame remedy againſt his Lord as an hired Servant may have. And of this ſort were our ancient Engliſh Villains, who though they could claim no property againſt their Lords, either in Goods or Lands; yet if the Lord killed his Villain, the Wife had an Appeal of Murder of the death of her Husband. Since no man can be ſuppoſed ſo void of common ſenſe (unleſs an abſolute Fool, and then he is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making any Bargain) to yield himſelf ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely up to anothers diſpoſal, as to renounce all hopes of ſafety or ſatisfaction in this life, or of future happineſs in that to come. So that I conceive that even a Slave (much more a Servant hired upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions) in the ſtate of Nature, where he hath no civil power to whom to appeal for Juſtice, hath as much Right as a Son or Child of the Family, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his life, or what belongs to him, againſt the unjuſt violence or rage of his Maſter. Nor do I think any places of Scripture, if well conſidered, command the contrary: For as for the places in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Servants, be obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh, with fear and trembling.</hi> And <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Servants, obey in all things your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> &amp;c. does not extend to all things that are, but only
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50833:57"/> to things lawful for them to do, that is, that were not againſt the Principles of Chriſtian Religion. And in this it is that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18,19. commands <hi>Servants or Slaves</hi> (which there were all one) <hi>to be ſubject to their Maſters, not onely to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward. For this is thank-worthy,</hi> or grateful, <hi>if a man for conſcience towards God, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, endure grief,</hi> or trouble, <hi>ſuffering wrongfully.</hi> Which words ſeem to import, that Servants ought to bear with a great deal of bad uſage from their Maſters; but does not command them in the ſtate of Nature to give up their Lives or Goods to their Maſters, without any reſiſtance. But if any ſhall urge the Example of Chriſt alleadged in the third verſe, who ſuffered (even to death) for us; I conceive that does not extend to a ſuffering or ſubmiſſion unto all things, but to ſuch things for which Chriſt himſelf ſuffered, <hi>viz.</hi> for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience toward God, that is, for matters of Religion; which is likewiſe moſt agreeable to the ſence of the words that follow: <hi>For what glory is it, if when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? but if when you do well, and take it patiently,</hi> &amp;c. Now who ever can imagine a Servant to be beaten for doing his duty? Therefore doing well, here, ſignifies the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity; which they were not to deny, though they had unbelieving Maſters. Therefore ſince no interpretation of Scripture ought to be againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that can never tell a man that he ought to yield up himſelf ſo wholly to anothers diſpoſal, as to give his Maſter an abſolute right and power over him to kill or maim him without cauſe, or to be ſo baſely and penuriouſly uſed as perpetually to ſuffer hunger, cold, and nakedneſs, or the like; ſo that his life ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther become a burden and a puniſhment, than a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. For ſince we have no notions of happineſs but in life, nor in that farther than it is accompanied
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50833:57"/> with ſome contentment of mind, no rational man can be ſuppoſed to conſent to renounce all the pleaſures and ends thereof, (and which onely make life deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) much leſs the Right of living and preſerving himſelf. So that even ſuch a Slave may without doubt in the ſtate of Nature, run away from his Maſter, and ſet himſelf at liberty if he can, ſince his Maſter hath not performed his part of that tacite condition of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; which was, that this Maſter ſhould for his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour provide him all the neceſſaries of life, and ſuffer him to enjoy the ordinary ſatisfactions of it. Nor is the worſt of Slaves, that is, one taken in War, ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely at his Maſters diſpoſe, as that becauſe he hath him in his power, he hath therefore a Right to uſe him as he will: For firſt, as long as the Conquerour keeps his Slave as a Priſoner, and makes him work in Fetters, though he hath given him his life for the preſent, yet there does not thence ariſe any Obligation in the Slave to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; ſo that the Slave may yet run away if he can, nay, kill his Conquerour, unleſs he will come to other Terms with him, and make him promiſe him his Service and Obedience upon the granting him his Liberty and enjoyment of the ordinary Comforts of Life: And if he cannot enjoy theſe, I believe there is no ſober Planter in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> (who are moſt of them the Aſſignees of Slaves taken in War) but will grant ſuch a Slave may lawfully run away if he can. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not true what Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ſays, That no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury can be done to a Slave: for his reaſon is not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, that becauſe a Servant hath abſolutely ſubjected his will to that of his Lords, therefore whatever he does, he does it by his Maſter's will, in which his own is included, ſo that <hi>volenti non fit injuria:</hi> this proves no more than that the Slave hath no juſt reaſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint though his Maſter give him Victuals that does not ſuit with his palate, orpreſcribe him Work which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50833:58"/> may not pleaſe his humour. So on the other ſide, what rational man will affirm, that this Slave hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up the natural Rights of living, and being preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a man, but that injury may be done to this Slave as any other Servant, if the Task impoſed upon him be beyond his ſtrength to perform, or if he be beaten or like to be put to death without cauſe, or that he hath not Food ſufficient to enable him to do his work? for he may ſtill require at his Maſters hands the uſage of a man, and of a rational Creature. So likewiſe though this property in the perſon of a Slave taken in War, may be aſſigned over to another, yet the Right of commanding a Slave by his own conſent, cannot be ſo, farther than it was agreed upon in the Bargain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his Lord: for if he convenanted to be a Slave onely to his Lord and no man elſe, the Lord cannot in juſtice aſſigne nor ſell him to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent, nor leave him to his Heirs; ſince there might be certain peculiar reaſons wherefore a man might ſubject himſelf to this man, and not to another. So likewiſe in abſolute Empires which began purely from Conqueſt, though it is taken for granted that they may be aliened at the Will of the Conquerour, yet it is otherwiſe in Subjects who have ſubmitted themſelves upon certain Conditions, and who have ſome Liberties remaining to them; and much more in thoſe Kingdoms which are limited by their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for there, not properly the Perſons of the men, but the Right of governing them, is ſaid to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as far as it is accompanied with the Honours and Profits annexed to it. For although a Prince may ſay of his Subject, He is my Man, yet this Property in him is much different from that whereby a Prince calls his Horſe his own: for in the firſt ſence he means no more than that the Right of governing this man belongs to me, and not to another, yet cannot be extended as far as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50833:58"/> he pleaſes; but that Property which is attributed to a Beaſt or other Goods, includes a Right of uſing or conſuming that thing as he will himſelf, without any other reaſon than that it is his own. But although the Laws of Humanity do not permit, that however a man hath carried himſelf towards us, all Remains of that Primitive Equality between men ſhould be quite extinguiſhed towards him; and after a man hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a ſtate of Peace with us, that he ſhould be dealt with as a Brute or inanimate thing: though it is true that the Cruelty and Avarice of divers Nations hath proceeded ſo far, that Slaves are reckoned amongſt Houſhold-goods, and are ordered not ſo much by Command, as by the force of an abſolute Dominion and Property; yet this is not from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Civil Law of that particular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. So that though I grant by the Roman Civil Law, a man might have ſaid of a Slave in the ſame ſence as of a Beaſt, This is mine; yet this was not from the Laws of Nature, but Cuſtom of that Empire, who taking many Captives in the Wars, almoſt all their Servants conſiſted at firſt of ſuch: Yet this is not allowed of in our Law, nor yet in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries. And this will ſerve to demonſtrate what this Author lays down in his Preface to his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Politicks to be falſe, That <hi>Adam</hi> was a Father, King, and Lord over his Family, and that a Son, Subject, and Slave, or Servant, were all one at firſt; ſince it may hereby appear that there is a real difference in Nature between every one of them. And though the expreſs names of Subject, Tyrant, and Slave, be not found in Scripture, yet the things are, and that as plainly deſcribed as if they had been called ſo; though the Hebrew being a barren Language, hath not diſtinct words for them, without Epithites or Circumlocutions: For (1.) As to Servants, it is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50833:59"/> apparent out of the Law of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.39.44. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.12. there is a vaſt difference between Hebrew Servants and thoſe that were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations; theſe latter onely being called Bondſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whoſe ſervice was perpetual, and who were as a Poſſeſſion and Inheritance to their Lords; whereas the former were not to be made to ſerve with that Rigour, but onely as hired Servants to be ſet free in the ſeventh or <hi>Sabbatical</hi> year. And it is frequent in the Law as well as Prophets, to make mention of the Wages of an Hireling. So that nothing is plainer, than that even among the Jews, there was a difference between hired Servants, Hebrew Servants for years, and forreign Slaves for ever. And before that, when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved <hi>Laban</hi> for his two Daughters, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there was then a diſtinction between an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Servant and a Slave, ſince there was a Contract for what Wages <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould ſerve him: And though <hi>Laban,</hi> for ought appears, according to the cuſtom of thoſe times, was an Independant Father of a Family, as well as <hi>Jacob</hi> was afterwards, and conſequently a Prince, as this Author needs will have it; yet we do not finde it charged upon <hi>Jacob</hi> as a Crime, no not by <hi>Laban</hi> himſelf, but onely as a matter of unkindneſs, that he had ſtolen away from him with his Daughters and the Goods he had yearned in his ſervice. So likewiſe, though the word Tyrant is not found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in Scripture, yet the thing it ſelf is, if a Tyrant be one who abuſus his Kingly Power to the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Subjects; or elſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thoſe Kings who after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> coming out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> ſo cruelly oppreſſed them, were all good and lawful Monarchs, and had as much Authority as their own Princes which God ſet over them: and it had been a wicked thing in them to have reſiſted them and driven them out as they did, whenever they were able; ſince
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50833:59"/> they were in poſſeſſion, according to this Author, by the permiſſive Will of God. Having now ſhewn the difference of the Power of a Maſter of a Family, from that of a Father, and that the Right which a Father hath in his Children, is divers from that which he hath in his Servants or Slaves; I will now conſider in the laſt place the Power which <hi>Adam</hi> had, or any other Husband now hath over his Wife in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I have already proved that the Authority of the Husband over the Wife, commences from that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract we call Marriage; and though by the Word of God the Woman is made ſubject to the Man, yet the reaſon of that ſubjection naturally depends upon the Mans being commonly ſtronger both in body and mind than the Woman; and where that ceaſes, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection will likewiſe of courſe ceaſe, even amongſt us: For we ſee that if a Husband be a fooliſh or a careleſs man, and either cannot or will not govern his Family and Eſtate, the Wife may and does, and oftentimes him into the Bargain: Nor does any one finde fault with her for ſo doing, ſince ſomebody muſt govern the Concerns of the Family; and if the man either cannot or will not, who hath more Right or Intereſt to do it, than her, who hath an equal ſhare in the happineſs and well-being of her Family and Children? Neither can there be at once two abſolute Heads in the ſame houſe commanding contradictory things, without confuſion, ſince the Children and Servants could never tell whom to obey. So that even this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the womans will to the mans, commanded by Scripture, is ſtill with a ſuppoſition that the man is capable or willing to govern: for if he be not, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this Prerogative of courſe. But ſuppoſe he is able to govern her and the Family, the Queſtion is, What kind of Power he hath over her, as a Husband, in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50833:60"/> ſtate of Nature? I grant, that if ſhe made it part of her Bargain to be ſo abſolutely ſubject to him as that he might command her in all things as a Slave, and make her do what work he pleaſed to appoint, and that he may either turn her away, or put her to death, if he find her imbezilling his Goods or committing Adultery; the woman in this caſe is bound by her Contract, as another Servant, who makes her ſelf ſo by her own act or conſent. But this is not the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but what power the man hath naturally over his Wife, as a Husband, ſuppoſing no ſuch Conditions or Bargain were made at the Marriage. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the Wife ought to be ſubject to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in all things tending to the good and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Children and Family, or elſe the Family would have two Heads (as I ſaid before.) But it does not therefore follow, that he hath ſuch a deſpotick power over her, that ſhe may in no caſe judge when he abuſes his Fatherly or Husbandly power: For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Father of a Family, in the ſtate of Nature, ſhould in a mad or drunken fit go about to kill or maim herſelf or one of his innocent Children, can any body think this were Rebellion againſt the Monarch of the Family, for the Wife to reſcue her innocent Child or ſelf out of his hands by force, if ſhe could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make him be at quiet? Or ſuppoſe the Husband in ſuch a fit ſhould command his Wife to deliver him a ſum of money which ſhe had in her keeping, when ſhe was morally ſure that he would preſently play it or otherwiſe ſquander it away; will any rational man affirm that a Wife may not deny to deliver her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his own money in ſuch circumſtances? So that it is evident, ſhe never ſo abſolutely ſubmitted her will to his, as not to reſerve to her ſelf the faculty of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional woman, as not to judge when her Husband would evidently deſtroy her ſelf or Children, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50833:60"/> ruine the Family, when he was not in a capacity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50833:61"/> reſulting from the conjunction of many into one Body; in which, although an abſolute Empire be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet ſince the Wife being but one weak woman, can contribute but very little to this end, it may very well ſuffice to the peace and unity of the Family, if ſhe be tyed to her Husband onely by a ſimple Compact by way of Friendſhip, without any deſpotick power over her. But the peculiar ends of Matrimony, which are the procreation and breeding up of Children, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding things neceſſary for the Family, may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be obtained, although the Husband be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with this deſpotick power (which ſuppoſes that of life and death, or other grievous puniſhments) and though the Wife be tyed by her Compact only and the Bonds of Amity; of which Compact the Husband being the Principal, does imitate that of an unequal League between Civil States, in which the Husband being the Head, the Wife owes him all due reſpect and obſervance; and he on the other ſide owes her maintenance and protection. Therefore I am not of the opinion of ſome, who will have the Husband, in the ſtate of Nature, to be endued with an abſolute power of life and death over his Wife; and that in this conſiſts the very quinteſſence of Marital power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, forſooth, that all Empire, when it is in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubject, and neither is exerciſed precariouſly by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, nor circumſcribed by any ſuperiour Power, does always import <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis</hi> over the Subject. But this is not ſo: for a man, in the ſtate of Nature, may become part of anothers Family, and yet make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in his Bargain that the Maſter of this Family ſhall not put him to death or miſuſe, unleſs it be for Crimes that deſerve death by the Law of God or Nature, or become a publick Enemy. And the Suppoſition is falſe, which firſt ſuppoſes ſuch an abſolute Empire to be in the Husband, as in the proper Subject; neither is there
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50833:61"/> any abſolute power of life and death neceſſary to the ends of Marriage: for if the woman commit ſmall faults, and will not be amended, the Husband may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her; if greater (as ſuppoſe Adultery) he may put her away, and likewiſe chuſe whether he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Children which he hath reaſon to believe he did not get himſelf. If ſhe murder her Children, or commit any other abominable ſin againſt Nature, ſhe may juſtly be cut off from the Family, and puniſht as a common Enemy to Mankind; and ſo ſhe might be if ſhe had not been his Wife; but Servant, or other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Family. Yet I do not affirm, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick Empire, or power of life and death, is againſt the Laws of Nature, or inconſiſtent with the ſtate of Matrimony, any more than the abſolute power of a good Prince ſhould deſtroy the love of his Subjects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, or the reverential fear we ought to have of God, deſtroy our love of him. Therefore as I have allowed that the woman may confer ſuch a power on her Husband over her ſelf, in the ſtate of Nature; ſo I grant this abſolute power may likewiſe be conferred on Husbands by the Civil Laws of particular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. Thus it is murder for a man in <hi>England</hi> to kill his Wife taken in the very act of Adultery; but it is not ſo in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and moſt other Countries, if he kill his Wife if he find her alone in another mans company, though it cannot be proved they have done any thing clſe to deſerve it.</p>
               <p>Having now gone over the whole power of the Head of a ſeparate Family, as a Father, Husband, and Maſter, and proved that no man is a Slave by Nature, or without his own Conſent (as a Slave by Compact) or without his fault, as a Slave taken in a juſt War; and that no Maſter of a Family hath ſuch Right in the perſon of one of theſe, but that he may do him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury if he take away his life, or puniſh him without
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50833:62"/> cauſe; and that ſuch even ſuch, a Slave may lawfully ſet himſelf free, if the Maſter do not perform his part of the Bargain. And having in the laſt place ſhewn what power a Husband hath over his Wife in the ſtate of Nature, and from whence it takes its Original; it is now time to anſwer thoſe Arguments and Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by this Author and others, <hi>That the Prince or Governour ſo elected by the Fathers of Families, or Frce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at their own diſpoſe (which I hold to be equivalent to the whole People) hath not onely his Nomination from them, but that it is from God alone that he derives his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power and Authority, with which he is endued upon his firſt acceptance of the Supreme Power; and if he ſhould accept it with any limitation, it were to reſtrain that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which God hath conferred upon him by his being made the Supreme Magiſtrate, and would hinder him from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that great Duty as he ought.</hi> In anſwer to which I have already proved, that no ſuch unlimited Power was conferred by God to any private man in the ſtate of Nature, as a Father, Husband, or Maſter; and therefore could not be given to any Civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, who is ſuppoſed to have no more power than the Father of the Family had before. A ſecond Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, <hi>That no particular man hath in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any power over his own life, and therefore cannot have any over the life of another man; and if one man hath not this power, neither have the People (which is but a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſiſting of ſingulars) any ſuch power, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot confer it on any other man: therefore every Prince muſt have this Soveraign Power of life and death, not from the People, but from God.</hi> In anſwer to which, I ſhall firſt of all deny the conſequence, that becauſe God hath not given a man a power over his own life, therefore he can have none over the perſon of another. For God gave man a Right to preſerve, but not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf, and ſo cannot diſpoſe of his own life
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50833:62"/> whenever he is weary of it. Therefore ſince the firſt Law of Nature is Self-preſervation, it is lawful for a man to uſe all means conducing to this end, that do not prejudice another mans Right in his particular life or happineſs; ſo that if any man aſſault me in the ſtate of Nature, I may defend my ſelf, and conſequently kill the Aſſailant, if I cannot otherwiſe eſcape. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will be replyed, that the intention here is not principally to kill the man, if it may be otherwiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; and that this Right is given men onely to preſerve their lives from being taken away at another mans pleaſure, but that no private man hath power to revenge an injury done to another or ones ſelf, in the ſtate of Nature, with death, but God, or him to whom God hath committed this power, according to St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall prove that this place does not deſtroy that which I maintain: for I grant that all Revenge taken, as the ſatisfaction ſome men take in the very doing evil or prejudice to another, is unlawful, even by the light of Nature. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Likewiſe where Magiſtracy is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, who is to bear the Sword for the puniſhment of evil doers? I grant all return of like for like to be unlawful, ſince he is appointed as a publick Judge to right thoſe that are injured, and maintain the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peace. But no Text forbids men to puniſh inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done either to themſelves or thoſe they have a concern for, in the ſtate of Nature; for this is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but a natural Puniſhment to deter men from committing violent and unjuſt actions that diſturb the peace of humane Society, ſince the wrong doer declares himſelf thereby a publick Enemy to all Mankind. And on this account <hi>Cain</hi> feared that (not his Father onely, hut) every one that met him, would ſlay him, that is, puniſh him for the death of their Brother or Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And if this were unlawful, then all War muſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50833:63"/> be ſo in the ſtate of Nature; and Princes being always in that ſtate in reſpect of each other, could never make any War for the gaining of Rights uſurped, or to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh for Injuries received. So that this power which a man in ſome caſes hath over the life of another, is onely given him by God for the common good and preſervation of Mankind, of which every particular perſon is a part: and ſo this power conferred upon the ſupreme Magiſtrate is no more, nor extends higher than that, though there are more things requiſite to the publick peace and ſafety of a Civil Government, than are to humane Society in the ſtate of Nature: And from hence do ſupreme Powers derive their Right of making poſitive Laws, and ordaining higher Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for Offences than the Laws of God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do expreſly appoint, as for Theſt, Coining, and the like. Nor is the Antecedent true, that no man in the ſtate of Nature hath a power to diſpoſe of his own life. For though it may be true that no man hath a Right to make away himſelf whenever he diſlikes his being here; yet it does not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but that for a greater good to the publick, any man, nay a Prince himſelf may lay down his life for his Peoples good: And therefore I doubt not but the Example of <hi>Codrus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> King was not onely lawful, but highly commendable, in facrificing his life for the good and ſafety of his People, ſuppoſing that all their Eſtates and Liberties depended upon that one Battel; much more for a private man to lay down his life to ſave ſome publick perſon highly uſeful to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society. And this much does the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſeem to admit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7. when he ſays, <hi>For ſcarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a good man ſome would even dare to die.</hi> Where by a righteous man, Expoſitors underſtand one who had ſufficiently done his duty in an ordinary private
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50833:63"/> capacity, yet contributed little to the publick good; whereas by a good man, is underſtood ſome perſon highly uſeful and beneficial to others; and for ſuch a one a man may not onely dare to die, but actually lay down his life if occaſion be. A ſecond Objection is, <hi>That if the ſupreme Magiſtrates Authority be derived from the People, then this Authority muſt be either inferiour or ſuperiour to it: If inferiour, how can the People be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or governed by that which is inferiour to its ſelf? If ſuperiour, how can the Effect be more noble than the Gauſe, ſince neither any particular Perſon nor the whole Multitude had Soveraign Authority, and therefore could not confer it upon others.</hi> To this I anſwer, That this Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being but the ſubmiſſion of the Wills of the Perſons that inſtitute it to the Will of him on whom they confer it, that he ſhould thereby make uſe of all their Powers for the common good of them all; and being therefore not any phyſical but moral Quality, may be produced in another by their Compact, who had it not formally in themſelves before: As from the Voices of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men ſinging together, there may ariſe a Harmony which was not in their particular Voices alone, though each of theſe Voices muſt be muſical to produce it. So every particular perſon having before, in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Right to preſerve himſelf and to govern his own actions, when many men joyn together to confer this care upon one or more, there ariſes a Political Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more noble, yet of the ſame kind with the other: for if the ſingulars had it not before in ſome meaſure, the univerſal could not have it all. So that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to alleadge, that Soveraignty is not derived from men, becauſe it cannot be found among a mans natural powers or faculties in the ſame manner, as it is in the ſupreme Magiſtrate, as if there were no other than Phyſical Qualities in nature; yet even in Phyſicks, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>Epicurus</hi> Hypotheſes of Atomes to be true,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50833:64"/> there will ariſe from their conjunction that quality in bodies which we call diviſibility, and yet each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Atome conſidered apart, being indiviſible, had it not alone. But to anſwer a diſtinction they uſe in this matter between the immediate <hi>efficient</hi> and the immediate <hi>conſtituent modus</hi> of Soveraignty; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs indeed, <hi>That by this Election and Transferring of the Power of the Fathers of Families, the Civil Soveraign is declared, but that it is from God alone that he receives his Soveraign Authority.</hi> If they mean by this transferring of Fatherly Power, any abſolute Power which God hath by any Law divine or natural, conferred upon the Fathers over their Children and Families; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, that this Fatherly power is neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, nor aſſigneable to another. If they mean any other Soveraignty diſtinct from this, then they muſt needs conceive this as an abſtracted <hi>Ens,</hi> or Phyſical quality, which is immediately produced by God, and conferred upon the perſon of the Soveraign at his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Declaration: but I ſee no reaſon of conſtituting here more Cauſes than needs (as one efficient, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecundary) or why God ſhould do that by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary unintelligible way of acting, which he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by a plain and eaſie one, ſince it is contrary to his other methods of acting in the courſe of Nature: For <hi>fruſtra fit per plura, quod poteſt fieri per pauciora;</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing as I have already proved (and as divers who are ſufficiently for Kingly Power do admit) that the People or Heads of Families have a freedom of ſetting up what kind of Government they pleaſe, either Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical or other; and if there were none other but Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracies or Democracies in the world, I would fain know what then would become of this notional Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty or Soveraignty? Now if any man ſhould ask them where this abſtracted Soveraignty exiſts before it finds a King to ſettle upon, and whether it be a Subſtance or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50833:64"/> an Accident: if the latter, how it can ſubſiſt without its Subject? or if the former, when it was created whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was at the beginning of the world, or like the Souls of men, <hi>creando infunditur, &amp; infundendo creatur?</hi> or whether there be one ſingle Soul of Soveraignty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all over the world, which being diſtributed, does, as it were, animate ſo many Kings? Alſo whether this Majeſty dies with the Monarch, or elſe ſurvives him as the Soul does the Body, and by a new Metempſychoſis immediately transfuſes it ſelf into his Succeſſour. If the Gentlemen of this Author's Principles pleaſe but to conſider theſe difficulties, I'll undertake they will finde them as hard to be reſolved as any the Author hath propoſed about all the Peoples agreeing or being the cauſe of this Soveraignty: But I will not deny that God is properly the original and efficient Cauſe of Soveraignty as of all good things, and particularly of that power whereby every individual Freeman in the ſtate of Nature, hath a power to diſpoſe of his actions for his own preſervation and the common good of mankind. And the particular powers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men being put together, conſtitute that which we call a Politick or Civil Power. And therefore his laſt Objection is eaſily anſwered, That if the People be any Cauſe of Soveraignty or Civil Power, they muſt have received this power from God, by which they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it on any other: But it can no way be proved that they received it from God; for God having, as I ſaid, imprinted upon mans Soul ſuch a tender care of his own good and preſervation, and hath likewiſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to preſerve Peace and Order amongſt men, in order to the common good and preſervation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and hath likewiſe given him reaſon to find out all means neceſſary for this end, amongſt which the conſtitution of Civil Government muſt be reckon'd as the principal; who can doubt but the faculty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50833:65"/> of Civil Government likewiſe proceeds from God the Author of Truth and giver of all good things? Thus the invention of Cloaths, Fire, and Houſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, though they were found out by man as his Inſtrument, for a help to his neceſſities and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weakneſs. <note place="margin">

So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe having no need of Clothes, and living but from hand to mouth, and taking care onely to provide meer neceſſaries of life, as they never have any ſuperfluities, ſo they have no Diſputes about them: and moſt of their things being eaſie to be provided, they are ſeldom known to ſteal them one from each other; and if a man catch another ſtealing any thing from him, he will be ſure to beat the Thief ſoundly, or may be mark him with the ſharp Tooth of a Beaſt they call an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goutye</hi> (which is the diſgracefulleſt puniſhment any man can ſuffer:) ſo that one of the main ends of a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50833:65"/> ſupreme power among us, <hi>viz.</hi> to decide Controverſies about Property, and puniſh Thieves, are there of no uſe. And as for other Injuries, ſuch as Maims, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the like, they have no certain Judges for any of theſe things; every man that is injured in any of theſe caſes, being his own Judge and Executioner, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that Law of an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; onely in Adultery the man hath power to kill both his Wife and the Adulterer, if taken in the act; and in Murder, and great Hurts or Maims, where the party injured is not able to revenge himſelf, his neer Relations will not fail to do it; and if they ſhould omit, they would be looked upon as Cowards or infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: ſo that being naturally loving to each other, and having no words of diſgrace to quarrel about, and other Quarrels happening but ſeldom, and no man maintaining or taking the part of the wrong-doer, or revenging the death of a Murderer or Adulterer, they have lived many Ages without any common Power to keep them at peace among themſelves; and yet they have much fewer Crimes committed amongſt them than us. It is true, they have Captains or Cacicks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but they have no power but in time of War; and when the Expedition is ended, though they pay them reverence and reſpect, and make them preſide in all their Councils and Aſſemblies, yet they have no Authority in time of Peace to puniſh or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion any man. So that if they lived in Iſlands which were either far diſtant from others, or elſe were inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and would make no forein Expeditions, they would not need ſo much as this Cacick, and ſo could live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without any other Government than that of the Fathers of Families over their Wives and Children. But perhaps it will be ſaid, theſe are Man-eaters and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous People, and ſo are not to be quoted as Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the reſt of mankind. It is true, the <hi>Braſilians</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50833:66"/> eat their Enemies taken in War, but the <hi>Caribbes</hi> do not. But as for the Obſervation of the other Laws of Nature, I will leave it to any man to judge which part of mankind obſerve them beſt; thoſe that can live peaceably together without either Judge or Gallows, or we that can ſcarce be at quiet, though we have them. But I have done this, onely to ſhew an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader what are the true reaſons of the neceſſity of a Civil Power amongſt us that have a full propriety in all Lands and Goods by the particular Laws of our Countries.</p>
               <p>Having now I hope diſpatcht the firſt part of my intended Task, which was to prove that the Author's Hypotheſis concerning the Monarchical Deſpotick Power of <hi>Adam</hi> over his Wife, Children, or Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, is altogether vain, and without juſt grounds either from Scripture or Reaſon; and conſequently that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Fathers of Families, nor the Princes as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them, can from divine Grant deduce any ſuch abſolute Power or Right over their Children or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with the anſwering of the reſt of this Treatiſe, having gone a good way in the ſecond Chapter, and anſwered his moſt material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections about the Peoples conferring Soveraignty; ſo that the reſt is of ſmall conſequence.

S. he there quotes, have been debated by ſo many Expoſitors both in Engliſh and Latine, I count needleſs to repeat out of others what ſenſe they may bear, though I do not approve of the Author's interpretation, who would have them appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alike to all Princes, whether good or bad, lawful or unlawful; ſince upon thoſe Principles there can be no difference between a juſt Prince and a Tyrant, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a lawful Monarch and an Uſurper. Nor ſhall I meddle with what he ſays concerning the Kings Power and Prerogative, though I think there are divers things which he there ſays, that are falſe and of very ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; yet ſince I confine my ſelf purely to the Laws of Nature and Reaſon, I ſhall leave it to other more able Pens, and better skill'd in the Laws and Cuſtoms of this Kingdom, to give him ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as they deſerve. Neither would I be thought to encourage Princes to ſtretch their Power to the utmoſt limits, nor yet to ſtir up Subjects to take Arms as ſoon as ever they think themſelves injured, ſince the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is but too apt, where they are left to be their own Judges, to pronounce Sentence in ther own favour. Therefore, quitting all theſe as unneceſſary Diſputes, I ſhall now proceed to take a ſhort view of the reſt of thoſe Errors and Miſtakes which remain yet to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his other Miſcellany-Treatiſes firſt publiſhed.</p>

               <p>I come now to the Author's Obſervations on <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s Politicks.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50833:68"/> that he never meant. And therefore I ſhall turn over to <hi>p.</hi> 12. where he quotes another place out of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s fourth Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>That the firſt Commonwealth among the</hi> Grecians, <hi>after Kingdoms, was made of thoſe that waged War:</hi> From whence he would infer, That the <hi>Grecians,</hi> after they left off to be governed by Kings, fell to be governed by an Army: So that any Nation or Kingdom that is not charged with the keeping of a King, muſt perpetually be at the charge of paying and keeping of an Army. Which, though it happened true during the corrupt Oligarchy of the <hi>Rump,</hi> which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ollows theſe words, That he meant no ſuch thing, a ſtanding Army in conſtant Pay being a thing unknown among the Greek Commonwealths, where every Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſerved in perſon as a Horſeman or on foot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ability, as any that reads thoſe Hiſtories may eaſily obſerve; and a Guard of Strangers, or a conſtant ſtanding Army, was ever held the Body of Tyranny (as it ſtill continues in all abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50833:69"/> had a ſhare in the Government who were actually in Arms, but thoſe alſo that had ſerved in the Army; for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays immediately after, <hi>That their Strength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted chiefly at firſt of Horſemen, and that as the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths increaſed in the ſtrength and number of them that were of ability or ſubſtance to bear Arms, the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commonwealth was communicated to more.</hi> From whence it appears, that (as alſo at firſt among the <hi>Romans</hi>) they onely had a Voice in their Councils or Aſſemblies, who were able to maintain themſelves in the Wars at their own charge: As amongſt us none have a Vote to chuſe Parliament-men, but Freeholders; or as in old times, none but thoſe who ſerved in the Wars in perſon, had Votes in the <hi>Withena Gemote,</hi> or Great Council: And yet this was no ſtanding Army no more than thoſe in <hi>Greece.</hi> So likewiſe neither are theſe words fairly rendered in the ſame page, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ready mentioned,</hi> viz. <hi>when it happens to many of them, who not being endued with the power of a Tyrant, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a Kingly Authority, become contemned whilſt they will unjuſtly abuſe their Subjects; for then there is an eaſie diſſolution of the Government; for he is not a true King over thoſe that like not his Government, but a Tyrant. P.</hi> 20, &amp; 21. He finds fault with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for making the main diſtinction between right Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thoſe that are imperfect or corrupt, to conſiſt ſolely in this, <hi>That where the profit of the governed is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, there is a right Government; but where the profit of the Governours is onely regarded, there is a corruption or tranſgreſſion of Government.</hi> By this it is ſuppoſed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that there may be a Government (which he calls a Tyranny) onely for the benefit of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. That this Suppoſition is falſe, may be proved from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, to inſtance in the point of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. And therefore the Author endeavours to make him contradict himſelf thus: <hi>Tyranny</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 7.) <hi>is a Deſpotical or Maſterly Monarchy,</hi> Now he confeſſeth, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>That in truth the Maſterly Government is profitable both to the Servant by nature, and the Maſter by nature:</hi> And he yields a ſolid reaſon for it, <hi>viz. It is not poſſible, if the Servant be deſtroyed, the Maſterſhip can be ſaved.</hi> Whence it may be inferred, <hi>That if the Maſterly Government of Tyrants cannot be ſafe without the preſervation of them whom they govern,</hi> it will follow, <hi>That a Tyrant cannot govern for his own profit onely.</hi> And thus his main definition of Tyranny fails, as being grounded on an impoſſible Suppoſition. By his own confeſſion, no Example can be ſhewn of any ſuch Government that ever was in the world, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> deſcribes Tyranny to be: for under the worſt of Kings, though many particular men have unjuſtly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, yet the Multitude, or People in general, have
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50833:70"/> found benefit and profit by the Government.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were alive, I doubt he would ſay this Author plaid the Sophiſter with him, and did not onely miſquote his words, but pervert his meaning. For firſt, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does not ſay in that place he quotes, (or in any other that I know of) <hi>That Tyranny is a Deſpotical or Maſterly Monarchy:</hi> And therefore all he builds upon this Conceſſion is falſe. It is true indeed, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Government of the Maſter is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table both to the Servant by nature, and the Maſter by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> (that is, upon his ſuppoſition that they are either ſo by nature.) But the Author omits what immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows, becauſe it would vindicate <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s true meaning: for his next words are, <hi>Nevertheleſs it</hi> (i. e. the Maſterly power) <hi>regards chiefly the profit of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and of the Servant but by accident; but Oecumenical Government, or that of a Maſter over the Wife, Children, and Servants, is for their ſakes whom he governs, and for the common good of them all.</hi> Hence it appears plainly, that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when he ſays that a Tyranny is for the benefit of the Governour alone, he does not mean that the Subjects can have no benefit at all by it, ſince it is the Tyrants intereſt they ſhould live and get Children, or elſe he would quickly want Subjects. Thus the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under the Tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> had Meat, Drink, and Cloaths, and were not ſo low kept but they got Children apace; and yet we find God thought them oppreſt, and heard their cry. But <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> clears the point, when he diſtinguiſhes an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſterly power over a Slave, from that of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Family; the Maſter in the former conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely his own profit, and the preſervation of the Slave but by accident; and ſo an ill-natured brutiſh Maſter takes care of the life of his Slave that works in the Mines or Sugar-works in the <hi>Indies,</hi> not out of any love to the perſon of the Slave, but becauſe he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50833:70"/> cannot ſubſiſt without him. So a Graſier or Butcher takes care of his Cattel that they thrive and do well (as they call it) yet every body knows that they take this care onely for their Carcaſſes, which yield them ſo much ready money at the Market. So that indeed a Tyrant onely conſiders his own good in the welfare of his Subjects, and looks upon them as no better than brute Beaſts, in which he hath an abſolute property to ſhear or kill, as he thinks it moſt conduces to his own profit; without conſidering to what end he is ſet over them: As the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> makes uſe of the bodies of his poor Chriſtian-ſlaves (for Subjects I cannot call them) to fill up Ditches, and to blunt the edge of his Enemies Swords. But that all Kings are bound to preſerve the Lands, Goods, and Lives of their Subjects, the Author himſelf confeſſes, (<hi>Patriarcha,</hi> p. 94.) <hi>Though not by any municipal Law, ſo much as the natural Law of a Father, which binds them to ratifie the Acts of their Forefathers and Predeceſſors in things neceſſary for the publick good of their Subjects.</hi> So then I hope there is ſome difference between the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Father over his Children, and that of an abſolute Lord over his Slaves, notwithſtanding our Author's Quotation out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whereby he would make them all one, <hi>viz. That a Kingdom will be a Fatherly Government:</hi> Which is true, if you take it in the beſt ſence, for that affection that Kings like Fathers ſhould have for their Subjects: And ſo it is plain <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> intended it, by the words immediately foregoing, thus; <hi>For the Society of a Father with his Sons, has an appearance of a Kingdom;</hi> not that it is ſo indeed. But to make an end with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> I will give you one place more which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does not quote fairly; <note place="margin">

               <p>I ſhall now curſorily look over the reſt of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; where (<hi>p.</hi> 23.) though it be true what <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> ſays, <hi>That the People muſt act as a Monarch, and become as one Perſon, before it can govern:</hi> So after they are ſo united into one Senate or Council, it is no good Argument to ſay, <hi>That the whole Multitude does not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern where the major part onely rules, becauſe many of the Multitude that are ſo aſſembled, are ſo far from having any part in the Government, that they themſelves are governed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and often contrary to their wills; thoſe people (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it) being the major part in one Vote, that are perhaps of another opinion in another: and ſo every change of buſineſs begets a new major part.</hi> For though it is true, every individual perſon does not actually agree to every Vote,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50833:71"/> yet implicitly he does, ſince at the firſt inſtitution of the Government, the firſt Compact was, That the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the major part ſhould conclude the whole Aſſembly; and whoever either then would not, or now refuſes to be ſo concluded, is ſtill in the ſtate of Nature, in reſpect of all the reſt, and is not to be lookt upon as a Member of that Commonwealth, but as an Enemy, and a Covenant-breaker.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not quarrel with the Author, if he hold that Monarchy does moſt conduce to the main ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Religion towards God, and Peace towards men; ſince I agree with him, that abſolute Monarchy (if a man could be ſure the Monarch would ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue prudent and juſt) were the beſt ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for mankind. Onely I cannot but ſmile to finde the Author (<hi>p.</hi> 27.) ſo much admire the high reſpect the great Turk pays the <hi>Mufti</hi> or chief Biſhop, as he calls him, (where by the by, I never heard the Turkiſh Church-Government was Epiſcopal before) yet every printed Relation can tell us, that this wonderful Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is but a meer piece of Pageantry, the Idol being of his own making, and whom he again unmakes at his pleaſure; a ſort of Ordination I ſuppoſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would not allow to thoſe of an indelible Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. It is true indeed what the Author affirms, (<hi>p.</hi> 29.) That <hi>Rome,</hi> being in any deſperate condition, was ſtill forced to flie to Monarchy, chuſing a Dictator with abſolute Power: Yet this was onely as a General in time of War, or ſome great civil Commotion being very near it; where it muſt be confeſt that the abſolute power of one is beſt at ſuch times, which needed a ſpeedy Remedy: And argues no more the <hi>Romans</hi> good opinion of Monarchy, than it does any mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Martial Law; which though perhaps the beſt that can be uſed in War, it will not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that it were to be choſen in times of Peace, no
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50833:72"/> more than becauſe Brandy may do a man good when he is ſick in his ſtomach, therefore he ought to drink it conſtantly. So that as one benefit of the Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was the help it gave them upon an Extremity, ſo the next happineſs they wiſht for after that was over was, that the Dictator would lay down his Office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were never more ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over and oppreſt, than when theſe Dictators held their Power by force, contrary to their Inſtitution, and longer than there was need of them; as may be ſeen in the Examples of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But the Conſuls, though they had in many things (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in calling the Senate, and in commanding the Army) a Kingly power, yet it was not abſolute, but was liable to be queſtioned by the Senate and People; as any man that reads the Roman Hiſtory may obſerve. [<hi>See the Oration of</hi> Valerius <hi>in</hi> Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>upon the difference between the Senate and People.</hi>] I ſhall not now ſtay to diſpute whether the People of <hi>Rome</hi> did well or ill in expelling <hi>Tarquin;</hi> but beſides his perſonal faults, he was never their lawful King having aſcended the Throne by the murder of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> and kept it by the power of a ſtanding Army, without the due Election of the Senate and People; which was contrary to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of that Kingdom, which was Elective.</p>
               <p>The Author (<hi>p.</hi> 32.) makes a great difficulty to grant the Roman Commonwealth to be Popular: It is true, it was not ſo abſolutely, but was mixt with an Ariſtocracy in the Government of the Senate, and with Regal power in the Authority of the Conſuls; yet it is plain, the ſupreme Power remained in the Body of the People: And though by the unequal diviſion of the Centuries, it is true, the greater part of the common People were ſeldom admitted to vote, being concluded by the major part of the firſt 97 Centuries, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50833:72"/> of the better and richer men; yet this inequality begot the <hi>Tributa Comitia,</hi> which (with the Author's good leave) was more abſolute than the former <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>I Shall therefore in the next place look over his miſcellany obſervations. (1) Upon divers modern Authors. As for Mr. <hi>Hob's Leviathan.</hi> I ſhall leave them to decide the controverſie as they pleaſe, and refer it to the readers judgment who hath the better on't: For in many things I think neither of them are in the right: only it is a hundred pitties Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> did not conſult the Author, and take in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcal Hypotheſis, and then all his rights of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing Soveraign Tyranny would have gone down well enough. But for my part I neither like the <hi>foundation</hi> nor the building which Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> hath ſet up, and therefore ſhall here leave the Author to build and pull down as he pleaſes without my intermedling.</p>
               <p>And leſs ſhall I take upon me to vindicate <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> ſince that were at once to defend downright Murder and Rebellion. So that I ſhall turn over to his obſervations upon <hi>Grotius,</hi> an Author of greater learning, and better reputation, than either of them. Where I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to defend the manifold diſtinctions, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 37.</note> and contradictions of the old Civil Lawyers about the Law of Nature, and the Law of Nations; or whether the natural, and Moral law be all one, it is ſufficient if <hi>Grotius</hi>'s didifinition of the law of Nature be true: Nor does it ſignifie any thing whether the word Law of nature be found in Scripture; Yet I think <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> may well enough be defended, that there is ſuch a thing too proved from 11. <hi>Romans v.</hi> 14, 15. For though he doth not ſay expreſly that nature is a Law unto them, but <hi>they are a law unto themſelves,</hi> yet certainly Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is to the ſame: For if the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50833:74"/> 
                  <hi>Gentiles</hi> by nature <hi>did the things contained in the law,</hi> and ſo were a law unto themſelves, I know not what elſe he can mean by their doing by nature <hi>the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the law,</hi> but their living according to the Laws of nature or right reaſon, which (all rational men are ſenſible of as ſoon as they come of an age able to exert this faculty and ſo) becomes by nature a Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves; neither can this be cuſtom, ſince Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays they do ſo by nature <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law.</p>
               <p>Neither do I ſee any Reaſon why <hi>Grotius</hi> is to be blamed for not taking his Hypotheſis concerning the Original of Mankind, of Dominion, and Property out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſince writing of the rights of Peace and War according to the laws of nature, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſent of civiliſed Nations, and not according to any revealed Will, or Law of God he was not bound (nay it was contrary to his purpoſe) to make uſe of Scripture farther than to confirm what could be made out from natural reaſon alone, for to have done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe had been to have written a treatiſe of caſes of Conſcience in Divinity, and not of right and wrong by the laws of nature. So that though he ſometimes make uſe of Texts of Scripture, yet it is either to ſtrengthen thoſe, or elſe to anſwer ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that may be drawn from thence againſt his concluſions. And therefore he was not obliged to take notice, whether God gave a begining to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from one man, or more at once, ſince it might if he had pleaſed have been either way. Nor yet did he dream of <hi>Adams</hi> Monarchy over the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before he had any Subjects to command, nor of his being ſole Lord Proprietor and firſt occupant of all the earth, and of all the Creatures in it, when neither he, nor his Children ever knew, nor made any uſe of the 1000. <hi>parts;</hi> of them, theſe were No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50833:74"/> too fine ſpun for a man of his ſolid judgment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to light on, ſo therefore we muſt be beholding to our Author and ſome Engliſh Divines for this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable diſcovery. Yet as I doubt not but if that great man were alive, he could well enough defend himſelf by that great reaſon, and learning he was Maſter of, againſt what ever this Author or ſome other leſſer Scriblers could reaſonably object againſt a work of that nature; yet I doubt not but moſt of thoſe things the Author obſerves as errors, may be well enough defended by one of far meaner parts, and leſs learning than <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf; ſo that I am not convinced that he either forgets or contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (as our Author will needs have him) when he refers <hi>alieni abſtinentia</hi> or abſtaining from that which belongs to another, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 59.</note> to conſiſt with a ſociable community of all things, becauſe ſays the Author, where there is Community, there can be neither <hi>meum nor tuum,</hi> nor yet <hi>alienum;</hi> and if there be no <hi>alienum,</hi> there can be no <hi>alieni abſtinentia,</hi> and ſo likewiſe by the Law of nature, men ought to ſtand to bargains, but if all things were common by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture how could there be any bargains.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, it will appear that a Propriety of occupancy or the perſonal poſſeſſion of things and applying it to the uſe of one or more men while they have need of it, may very well conſiſt with commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and is abſolutely neceſſary to the preſervation of Mankind: As for Example, a Theater is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all that have a right of coming thither, but no man can ſay that one place in it is more his than anothers, untill he is ſeated in it, and then that place is ſo much his, that whileſt the Play laſts no man can without injury put him out of it; ſo likewiſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Earth and fruits thereof to have been at firſt beſtowed in Common on all its inhabitants; yet ſince Gods firſt Command to man was, encreaſe and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50833:75"/> multiply, if he hath a right to perform the end, he hath certainly a right to the means of his preſervation, and the propagation of his ſpecies, ſo that though the fruits of the earth, or beaſts, for food were all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet when once any man had by his own labour acquired ſuch a proportion of either as would ſerve the neceſſities of himſelf, and Family, they became ſo much his own, as that no man could without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt injuſtice rob him of theſe neceſſities of life; and this ſort of Community was moſt Primitive, and Natural, being ſtill retained among the <hi>Americans</hi> to this day, the reſt of the Country lying ſtill in common, neither can any <hi>Indian</hi> preſcribe to this or that Tree, that grows out of his own Garden, or to any of the wild Beaſts, that this is his more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, until he hath either gathered thoſe or killed the other, and then all look upon it as robbery to take from each other, what they are once poſſeſſed of; ſo likewiſe in this ſtate of Community, if an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> make a bargain with another to give him ſome of his venizon for ſuch a proportion of maiz or roots, there is never an honeſt <hi>Indian</hi> but will judge the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker bound to make good his bargain without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; ſo likewiſe if any two or more of them make a bargain to go a hunting, or fiſhing together, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that the Venizon, or Fiſh that they ſhall take be equally divided amongſt them all, I think every one of them will think himſelf wronged if one of them cheat or ſteal from the reſt before the quarry come to be divided. So that you may ſee how true it is which this Author affirms, <hi>that if all things were common by nature there could be no contracts, agreeable to which is the Hypotheſis layd down by</hi> Grotius; <q rend="inline">'that God imediately after the Creation did beſtow upon Mankind in general a right over all things of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerior nature, from whence it came to paſs, that preſently every man might take what he would for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50833:75"/> his own occaſions, and that ſuch an univerſal right was inſtead of property, for what every man ſo took, another could not take from him but by injury.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it ſeems our Author will have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Scripture, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 46.</note> becauſe Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Mare clauſum</hi> (from I know not what Tradition of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>) <q rend="inline">'<hi>ſuppoſes that</hi> Adam <hi>by donation from God, Gen.</hi> 1.28. was made general Lord of all things, not without ſuch a private dominion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as (without his grant) did exclude his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that by donation, aſſgnation, or ſome kind of ceſſion (before he was dead or left any heir to ſucceed him) his Children had their diſtinct terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by private dominion; <hi>Abel</hi> had his flocks, and paſtures for them; <hi>Cane</hi> had his fields for Corn, and the land of <hi>Nod</hi> where he built himſelf a City.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the confutation of which opinion, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved that <hi>Adams</hi> abſolute dominion over the lives and perſons of his Children is not to be deduced from that place of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> before cited by Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi> Let us now conſider whether <hi>Adam</hi> had by theſe words an abſolute dominion over the world and all things therein, diſtinct from that of his wife and Children, <hi>the words are Male and Female created he them, and God bleſſed them, and God ſaid unto them, be fruitful and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iply and repleniſh the Earth, and ſubdue it, and have do minion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowel of the Air; and over every living thing that moveth upon the face of the Waters.)</hi> From whence it may be obſerved, 1. That though theſe words are placed before the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Eve</hi> by a Prolepſis (very uſual in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) yet it is apparent that they muſt have been ſpoken after it, by theſe words male and female cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated he them, ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> could not ſpeak of a Female untill the woman was made. 2. That this Dominion over the creatures is given unto them both joyntly, the grant of the Dominion as well as the bleſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50833:76"/> given alike to them. And God bleſſed them, and ſaid unto them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. That it does not appear that this Dominion was perſonal to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> alone, excluſivly to their Children, and deſcendents, ſo that none of them could eat, or diſpoſe of any fruits of the Earth for the ſupplying of the neceſſities of nature without their leave, for the words are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Male and Female created he them; and ſo ſeem, though ſpoke to the perſons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> as the Protoplaſts of Mankind to relate to all the Males, and Females that ever ſhould be born. 4. That this Dominion was not abſolute to diſpoſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as they pleaſed, ſince the previledge of uſing them for food was not given until after the flood. So if theſe words in <hi>Geneſis</hi> do not prove an abſolute Dominion in <hi>Adam,</hi> over all things, I do not ſee any other place that can; for though it is true that God after the fall made the woman ſubject to her husband; yet I do not ſee why ſhe ſhould therefore looſe her right of preſerving her ſelf by the fruits of the earth, or her uſing any of the Creatures, ſuppoſe the milk of a Cow without her husbands conſent. For if <hi>Adam</hi> had been at any time in an ill humour (all the things in the world being his) ſhould he have but forbid her to eat any of them without his leave, our great Grandmother might have ſtarved without all remedy.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe had he been at any time angry with any of his Sons, and had forbid them to touch ſo much as an Apple, they muſt either have periſhed, or if they had filled their bellys, been at once guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Theft, and diſobedience; ſo that it had been in his power without any violence to have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their lives when he pleaſed. But I cannot think it rational, neither is it conſonant to Scripture, that God gave <hi>Adam</hi> ſuch a deſpotick power over all things; for ſince all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> had as much right to their lives as <hi>Adam</hi> had himſelf, it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50833:76"/> muſt likewiſe follow, that they had as good a right to the fruits of the earth, which were then the only means to maintain it, and conſequently might have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their bellies when they pleaſed with any of the natural products of the earth, without their Fathers leave; for the Pſalmiſt ſaith, God gave the Earth to the Children of men, that is, not to any one man, nor yet abſolutely in common, but to be either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, or uſed in common, as they ſhould find it ſtand beſt with their convenience and way of living; ſo that I ſhall not much diſpute with the Author whether <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> had their ſeparate Paſtures for their Flocks by the Aſſignment of their Father; though I believe it will be a pretty hard task to prove that <hi>Cain,</hi> when he ran away for his brothers murder, enjoyed the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> where he built a City by his fathers ſettlement. But though Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and the Author agree very well about the diſtinct Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet they do not ſo concerning that of <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Sons, whom Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> (and I think with very good reaſon) from <hi>Gen. IX.</hi> 2. Will have to be joynt Commonors with their Father in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the world and all its creatures; but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays, that the Text doth not warrant it. <q rend="inline">'For though the Sons are mentioned in the bleſſing, yet it may be beſt underſtood with a ſubordination, or benediction in ſucceſſion, the bleſſing might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, if the Sons either under or after their Father enjoyed a private dominion:</q> It is apparent that the words rather warrant the contrary. For the Text does not mention any bleſſing in ſubordination but is alike in preſent to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, for God ſpake to <hi>Noah</hi> and to his Sons, and ſo is their power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the creatures: as appears <hi>v.</hi> 3.

As for this Authors other argument from the private dominion of <hi>Adam,</hi> it might be good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who had admitted it before, but is none againſt thoſe that do not believe any ſuch grant. As for <hi>Noah</hi>'s being ſole heir of the world, he takes that for granted (which is no law of nature) that in the ſtate of nature one man is more an heir to his Father (or any other relation) than another; but having confuted that opinion already, I need ſay no more of it here.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> account of the original of Propriety, <q rend="inline">'After <hi>Noah</hi> is, that in diſtributing Territories, the conſent of Mankind paſſing their promiſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact (which did alſo bind their Poſterity) did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene ſo, that men departed from their common right of Communion of thoſe things, which were ſo diſtributed to particular Lords and Maſters. But the Author replys, that this diſtribution by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Mankind we muſt take upon truſt, for there is not the leaſt proof of it out of Antiquity:</q> If by Antiquity he means prophane Authors, all of them; both Hiſtorians and Poets that have writ of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject are for a primitive Community of all things, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the life of Man: As any man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what the Poets ſay concerning the golden Age, whoſe cheif happineſs they place in mens enjoyment of the fruits of the earth in Common, nor does <hi>Lactantius Li. V. Inſt. Cap.</hi> 5. one of the learnedſt of the Fathers interpret thoſe paſſages otherwiſe. If by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity he means proof out of Scripture; that neither makes for or againſt this opinion, the Scriptures not being written to ſhew us the originals either of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or Propriety, any more than to teach men Chymiſtry or Aſtronomy, though there be ſome ſo ſottiſh to think they thus find ſome grounds for their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50833:77"/> Fancies in thoſe ſtudies; yet it appears that the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was all, or moſt of it in Common in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time, or elſe he could never have lived, and kept his flocks upon it as a ſeparate Maſter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, without becoming ſubject to any other Prince. But however I look upon this Tradition delivered by the Greek and Latin Authors every whit as good as that Jewiſh one which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> quotes out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, and Cednenus:</hi> though he does not lay any ſtreſs upon it. But our Author admits it as an undeniable Record. That <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf as Lord of all was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the diſtribution of the world, and of all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate dominion, and that by an appointment of an oracle from God he did confirm this Diſtribution by <q rend="inline">'his laſt Will and Teſtament, which at his death he left in the hands of <hi>Shem,</hi> his eldeſt Son, and alſo warned all his Sons that none of them ſhould invade any of their brothers dominions, or injure one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becauſe from thence diſcord, and civil war, would enſue.</q> Its not likely that the Antient <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould know any thing of this Will of <hi>Noahs,</hi> for if they had, ſo diligent an Author, and ſo well verſed in the Jewiſh Antiquities as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> would not have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo famous a piece of hiſtory. 2. The <hi>Rahbins</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſequently our Fathers of the Church are not agreed whether <hi>Shem</hi> or <hi>Japhet</hi> were the eldeſt. For though it is true that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and thoſe Fathers that follow the vulgar tranſlation, made <hi>Shem</hi> the eldeſt; yet St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and all the Fathers of the Greek Church, who therein follow the <hi>LXX. Verſior,</hi> as of greater Antiquity and Authority, are for <hi>Japhets</hi> being the eldeſt brother: So that this Teſtament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left in <hi>Shems</hi> hands is a meer Rabinical inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it being much to be doubted whether Letters, much more Wills in writing were in faſhion, in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s days, and if <hi>Noah</hi> left no Will, which no Jury
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50833:78"/> can now decide) then the world was left to <hi>Noahs</hi> Sons, Grand-children in Common to be divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral occaſions, ſince they all three had equal right to it: But it ſeems a weak Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis if it ſerve the Authors preſent purpoſe ſhall be received, though it contradict his other Principles: For in his <hi>Patriarcha</hi> and other of his treatiſes he makes <hi>Adam</hi> ſole Monarch of the World, and that this right deſcended wholy and entirely to <hi>Adam</hi>'s right heir; But here we find <hi>Noah</hi> turns the Propriety and Dominion of the world into an abſolute gavel-kind, and diſtributing the Earth among his three Sons, makes them all Heirs and Monarchs alike, ſo that <hi>Shem</hi> the elder is here diſinhereted not only of his entire Dominion in the world, but alſo of his natural right of Lording it over the reſt of his bretheren, ſo that whereas the whole world ſhould have been his, if his Father had not made this unlucky Will, he is fain to be content with a third part. I ſhall paſs by other impoſſibilities in this fancy of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Will, as how <hi>Noah</hi> ſhould by revelation make a diſtribution of the Earth among his Sons, when he never had diſcovered a hundreth part of it. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and the Fathers not ſuppoſing him ever to have deſcended from the Mountains of <hi>Ararat</hi> into the Plains all his life time. But to paſs over ſuch Romantick fancies, let us come to the Authors more ſolid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Why Dominion, and Property could not be introduced by the voluntary conſent of Men, and therefore muſt needs (P. 70.) have begun from <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> appointment.

And if ſuch an occupancy will not create a Propriety, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all the Nations in the world are in an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; For ſince none of them can now convey their Titles to the Country they poſſeſs from any one of <hi>Noahs</hi> Sons if occupancy or poſſeſſion be no good Title, then the reſt of Mankind may upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors own Principles come in for a ſhare wherever they pleaſe; for certainly all the land that then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained undiſcovered (which could not be leſs than two parts of three) and conſequently undivided amongſt <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons, muſt afterwards fall either to the firſt occupiers, or all the reſt of Mankind muſt

So there is no need either of ſuppoſing the original of Property to have proceeded from <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, or elſe from the common conſent of all mankind at once, ſince no man hath a natural right to any more things than he could make uſe of, nor any right at all to thoſe he had no need of, nor had actualy ſeiſed, for his own uſe: This being I hope thus far cleared, I will not take upon me to maintain what <hi>Grotius</hi> aſſerts, that after Property was once introduced, it was againſt the law of nature to uſe community, ſince neither community, nor Property are by the abſolute law of nature, [God having beſtowed the fruits of the Earth on the Sons of Men for their uſes] but as for manner of uſing them, whether in Propriety or in common, he left it to the diſcretions of thoſe ſeveral parcels of Mankind who agreed to live together in civil ſociety or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as it might either way conduce to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of living, or common ſafety and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: For as where a Country is thinly peopled, and produces all the neceſſaries for life only by the labour of the Inhabitants in hunting, fiſhing, and the like imployments of that life which we call barbarous, becauſe it does not exerciſe it ſelf in day Labour, and that the People do neither need nor deſire thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous things that others doe, there is no need of encloſing or appropriating any more Land than they really make uſe of, more being but a burthen to them, ſo likewiſe where the People are more than the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can well maintain from its own Products, there will preſently ariſe a neceſſity of diviſion of lands in the firſt place; and of Trade abroad in the next; or elſe the People muſt either diſcharge themſelves into their neighbours territories, or live by robbing, or playing the Pyrates upon their neighbours, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Tartars, Arabs and Algerines;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when a Country is once divided, and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50833:83"/> the Law was only intended to take place, as far as the Subject was capable. Having now anſwered all the conſiderable Arguments that can be made againſt the poſſibility of a primitive Communion. I hope this great difficulty which hath puzled ſome Divines, which is <hi>prior in nature,</hi> Propriety or civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is now cleared, ſince it is apparent, Propriety, underſtood either as the application of natural things to the uſes of particular Men, or elſe as the general agreement of many men in the diviſion of a Teritory, or Kingdom, muſt be before Government, one main end of which is to maintain the Dominion or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty before agreed on.</p>
               <p>Having run over all that is moſt conſiderable in theſe obſervations, both concerning the natural Dominion of <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently ſhewn the original of Dominion and Property, I ſhall concern my ſelf very little, in the difference between the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and <hi>Grotius,</hi> concerning the Power of the people to reſiſt and puniſh Kings, in which I ſhall ſay no more, than that a Prince who is ſubject to be ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, is not really a King, in the ſenſe that the word King ought to be underſtood, ſince a King is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one that hath no Superior, and conſequently is not capable of Puniſhment; all puniſhments as I ſaid before, being properly the effects of a Superior, over an Inferior; ſo that the Kings of <hi>Sparta</hi> were no more than Generals of the Army, and if the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould have the title of King given him to morrow, he would ſtill be but the Head of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſince the one was liable to be put to death by the Ephori, as the other is ſtill by the Counſel of Ten. But if there are any ſuch deſperate inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences (as the Author mentions) that attend this Doctrine of natural freedom, and Community of all things, it is more than I can find, or I believe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50833:83"/> any man elſe, that will conſider the nature of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and when that is done, if things are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

By a temporary right, I think in moſt things <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> may very well be defended, though not in all. For whereas he acknowledges two ways, whereby a King may obtain a full right of Propriety, in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: That is either by a juſt war, or by donation from the People. I do not ſee the Author finds fault with him upon any juſt grounds, becauſe he hath not ſhewn how a War can be juſt without a precedent Title in the Conqueror, as if no war could be juſt, nor no Conqueſt made without ſuch a precedent Title: For all men know that a war may commence upon other ſcores, than old Titles, and in ſuch wars the Prince, or State that hath the right of their ſide, may proſecute this war, either untill they gain this firſt demand, or elſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſubdue their Adverſary.

For if he were an abſolue Monarch before he were put out, he cannot Attain more than he had before; ſo if he, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall not trouble my ſelf about the reaſons the Author gives for it: But I think he is out in making it ſeem impoſſible from what <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> hath ſaid, for a Prince to gain a full right of Propriety by a juſt War, for <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and allows that in ſome caſes a Prince may gain an abſolute dominion by Conqueſt.

As for Poſſeſſion it is true, that it is unjuſt for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man to Conquer him, that hath but a Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Kingdom, if that be the only ground of the quarrel: But neither <hi>Grotius,</hi> nor any reaſonable man elſe, will allow the Conquerour of ſuch a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor that wants a Title, to have gained an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute right over the People, ſince the Uſurper himſelf commanded them only by force, and that they never confirmed his Title by any after conſent. 'Tis true <hi>Grotius</hi> defines publick Subjection, to be that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a People yeilds it ſelf up to the Government of any one, or more men, or alſo to another People: But he limits this Subjection to that which proceeds
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50833:85"/> from conſent, as he divides Subjection, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent into publick, <note place="margin">

So that it is evident that the Author never read <hi>Grotius</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or elſe miſrepreſents his ſence on purpoſe, though I am ſo charitable as rather to believe the former, than the latter. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſ.

It is ſayd, as for the People, he removed them
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50833:85"/> to Cities, from one end of the borders of <hi>Egypt,</hi> even to the other end thereof; that is, he made Colonies of them, and changed the places of their abode; or perhaps made them ſervants to work in publick works, or manufactures, ſo that they that dwelt in the North of <hi>Egypt</hi> he removed into the South, that they might be out of their own Country, and have leſs intereſt or temptation to challenge their own lands again, when the Famin ſhould be over. From whence it is clear that a People that were free Subjects, may without a War give up themſelves, and all that they have to the Dominion of another; But ſince this inſtance may ſeem of too long ſtanding, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one that may happen nearer home; ſuppoſe the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> being threatned by the <hi>French</hi> King, to make War upon them, if they do not give up themſelves to be his abſolute Subjects, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe being Maſter at Sea, <hi>(as God knows after the rate his power now encreaſes, but that he may be ſo)</hi> he threaten to cut their Banks and let in the Sea to drown them, and their Country, if they will not yeild it up to him; may they not if they find they cannot reſiſt him, ſubmit themſelves to him, and make the beſt terms they can for themſelves, and are they not then obliged by the Authors own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to continue his Subjects? and yet here is no actual War, or inundation, but threats only, to force them to this ſubmiſſion. So that the Authors Suppoſition is falſe, that no caſe can happen but an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual War only, which can reduce a People to ſuch terms of extremity, as to compell them to an abſolute <hi>abnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> of all Soveraignity, and ſo likewiſe is this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence alſo which he aſſumes from thence; <hi>then war which cauſeth that neceſſity is the prime means of extorting ſuch Soveraignity, and not the free gift of the People, who cannot otherwiſe chuſe but give away that Power, which they cannot keep; for they might either leave their Country or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50833:86"/> bury themſelves in it.</hi> But it ſeems the Author had forgot his Logick, or elſe he would have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> and <hi>Cauſa efficiens,</hi> a cauſe which does not properly give being to a thing, and yet without which it could not have been produced: Thus a Slave at <hi>Argiers</hi> though it is the occaſion of his ſervitude his being taken Priſoner, yet the true Cauſe of his becoming a lawful Servant to his taker, does not proceed from his conquering him, but from his coming to Terms with him, that he ſhall be diſmiſt of his Fetters, or Impriſonment, upon Condition he will ſerve faithfully and not run away, and all Moraliſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe actions they call mixt; as when a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant flings his goods over into the Sea to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt away among the number of the Voluntary ones, though they commenced from ſome kind of force, ſince in this caſe the Merchant might if he pleaſed keep his goods if he would venture his life. So in many caſes may a Conquered People, if they have never neither by themſelves, or their repreſentatives owned the Conquerer. But as much as the Author quarrells at the word uſufructuary Right in <hi>Grotius,</hi> as too baſe to expreſs the Right of Kings, and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to the dignity of Supreme Majeſty; yet the the <hi>French</hi> are not ſo ſcruplous; but in the abſoluteſt Monarchy of <hi>Europe,</hi> plainly declare that their King hath but an uſufructuary right to his Kingdom, and the Territories belonging thereunto, or that he can any way charge them with his debts, or alienate, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them; without the conſent of the States of France, <note place="margin">

By the holy Croſs with which I am ſigned I would willingly do it, if my Counſel (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Eſtates) would permit it, becauſe I love the King of <hi>England</hi> as my Coſen; but it were hard at this very inſtant of my Pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age (<hi>viz.</hi> for the holy land) to diſturb the whole body of my Kingdom, by contradicting the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of my Mother, and all my Nobles, although the Interceſſors are very dear to me; neither is this to make a Kingdom all one with a Ferm (as the Author words it) ſince in the civil Law it ſignifies not only one that barely receives the rents, or profits, but likewiſe enjoys all other Prerogatives and advantages that may accrew to him as the true owner, though he have not power to ſell or give it away; Nor I ſuppoſe will any French or Engliſh Subject (unleſs ſuch bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted ones as the Author) acknowledge any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince, or other Perſon can obtain an abſolute Dominion over them by Conqueſt. I am ſure they were not of that opinion between two hundred, and three hundred years agoe, when the King of <hi>England</hi> brought a plauſible Title into <hi>France,</hi> and had it backt by almoſt an entire Conqueſt of the whole Kingdom, and a formal ſetlement and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Charles VI.</hi> then King and the greateſt part of the Nobility and Clergy of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Paris:</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:50833:87"/> and yet after all this, the French had ſo little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as to proclame <hi>Charles</hi> the Dauphin King of <hi>France,</hi> and to drive the Engliſh out of the Country, and renounce their allegiance which they had ſworn to our Kings, <hi>Henry V.</hi> and <hi>VI.</hi> and yet the Author will have it to be but a naked preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Grotius</hi> to ſuppoſe <hi>The Primary will of the People to have been ever neceſſary, <note place="margin">

And ſince Religion with theſe Gentlemen diminiſhes nothing from the right, and abſoluteneſs of Monarchy; the ſame King might have made over his Kingdom to the Emperor of <hi>Moroco</hi> (as the Hiſtorians of thoſe times relate he would) and ſo the Sarracen Prince might have entred upon the non-performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and have turned out his Vaſſal, and been King here himſelf; which opinion how contrary it was to the notions which Kings themſelves had of the right to diſpoſe of their Kingdoms, let any man conſult <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> and he will ſee there what <hi>Phillip Aguſtus amongſt other things tells</hi> Wallo <hi>the Popes Legate, <note place="margin">

               <p>And every Monarch hath as abſolute a Propriety in his Kingdom, as <hi>Noah</hi> had in the World, as our Author ſuppoſes, I know no reaſon why the King may not bequeath his Crown to which of his Sons he pleaſes, no matter whether lawfully begot or not, ſince Princes are above all Terms, or poſitive Laws, or he may divide it among them, as <hi>Noah</hi> did the World to his three Sons: So that upon theſe grounds the Teſtament of <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> whereby he diſinherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Line of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that of <hi>Edward VI.</hi> whereby he excluded his Siſters from the Crown ſhould have been valid, but the Loyal Subjects of <hi>England</hi> beleived that neither of thoſe Kings could diſinherit the right Heir of the Crown by their Teſtaments alone, but acknowledge them in the perſons of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe pretended Wills. I have been the larger upon this Subject that men that do not much conſider, nor are verſed in theſe matters, may ſee the abſurd, wicked conſequences of this notion, of an abſolute Propriety and Dominion, to be inſeper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from Monarchy: So that I doubt not but even thoſe very men who love a ſmatch of arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50833:88"/> becauſe it beſt ſuits with their tempers, or intereſts, cannot away with it unmixt, when it comes to exert all its Prerogatives: Thus ſome men think Musk, and Ambergreece mixt whith other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients makes an agreeable Perfume, which if held to their noſes in the Cod, or whole Lump, they are ſo far from thinking a good ſmell, that they loath it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not affirm with <hi>Grotius That the Empire which is exerciſed by Kings, doth not ceaſe to be the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the People:</hi> For I ſuppoſe the People have paſſed over all their preſent intereſt in it, to the Prince and his heirs, and as long as that line laſts they have nothing to do with it, and conſequently cannot ſet up another Family over them; and ſo on the other ſide the King hath no ſuch abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as that he can alter the ſucceſſion otherwiſe than the fundamental laws of the Monarchy did firſt appoint; which were made by conſent of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and without which they cannot be altered; nor is there any fear of a contradiction, as the Author ſuppoſes, [<hi>That the Succeſſion muſt either hinder the right of Alienation which is in the People, or the alienation muſt deſtroy the right of ſucceſſion, which muſt attend upon elected Kings.</hi> For we own no right of alienation in the People, as long as there is a lawful Heir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining and ſucceeding in his right, to whom the Crown was firſt legally ſetled; nor yet does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſucceſſion diminiſh the right which the People had at firſt, but that it may ariſe and take place again if the King ſhould die without known heirs.</p>

               <p>But it ſeems the Author allows, <note place="margin">260.</note> that there may be a mixt Government; but not a mixt Monarchy, becauſe the word Monarchy is compounded of two Greek words <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> to Govern, or Rule: and therefore Monarchy being the Government of one man alone cannot admit of any limitation or mixture.</p>
               <p>But what if one ſhould ſay that all this is nothing but wrangling about words: ſince why may not he be called a Monarch who hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, though not the only Power in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, if the cuſtom of that Country allow it him, though his Power be limited or mixt, as well as for the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to call their Monarch but Imperator, or General: or for the <hi>Florentines,</hi> or <hi>Ruſſians</hi> to call their Monarch great Duke: Since it is not the names, but the exerciſe of the power that creates the difference: Nor is it any more a Bull, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction than to call that which I now write out of, an Inkhorn, though perhaps it is made either of Glaſs, or Mettal; So the firſt Monarch being abſolute, the Title of Monarch, may now be by euſtom well enough applyed to thoſe that are not abſolutely ſo; but to paſs by ſuch Grammar niceties, I ſhall endeavour to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the writer of this Treatiſe of Monarchy, whom
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50833:89"/> the Author calls Mr. <hi>Hunton,</hi> from giveing an Idea of a Government, which is nothing but meer Anarchy and Fiction: and that there hath been, and yet is ſuch a kind of Government as a limited Kingſhip; which if the Author is ſo dogged, as he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it the name of a Monarchy, we cannot help it, let his Friends give it a more proper name if they pleaſe: As for what he will prove out of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors words that every Monarch (even his limited Monarch) muſt have the Supreme Power of the ſtate in himſelf, ſo that his Power muſt no way be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any power above his: <hi>For then he were no Monarch, but a ſubordinate Magiſtrate, is true; yet I do not ſee that the Author contradicts himſelf as the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour will have him, when he tells us in the ſame Page, That in a moderate, or limited Monarchy, the ſupreme power muſt be reſtrained by ſome law according to which this power was given, and by direction of which this power muſt act: So that he will have his Supreme Power not limited, and yet reſtrained: Is not a reſtraint, a limitation? and if reſtrained, how is it Supreme? and if reſtrained by ſome law, is not the Power of that law, and of them that made it above his Supreme Power? and if by the direction of ſuch law only he muſt Govern, where is the Legiſlative Power, which is the cheif of ſupreme Powers? when the law muſt rule and govern the Monarch, and not the Monarch the law; he hath then at beſt but a gubernative or executive Power: and ſo proceeds to quote this Authors own words at large, if his Authority tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends his bounds, and if it command beyond the Law, and the Subject is not bound Legally to ſubjection in ſuch caſes, and if the utmoſt extent of the Law of the land be the meaſure of the limited Monarch's Power, and Subjects duty where ſhall we find the Supreme, that</hi> Culmen, <hi>or</hi> apex poteſtatis <hi>that prime <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50833:89"/> Principality and Power, doth alſo ſignifie beginning, which doth teach us that by the word Prince, or Principality, or</hi> Principium <hi>or beginning of Government is meant; this if it be given to the law, it robs the Monarch, and makes the law the</hi> Primum Mobile; <hi>and ſo that which is but the inſtrument or ſervant to the Monarch becomes the Maſter.</hi> In vindication therefore of Mr. <hi>Hunton,</hi> on whom he makes theſe remarks, I ſhall in the firſt place grant that he hath perhaps ſpoke not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, in ſaying that the ſupreme Power muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by ſome law, whereas indeed he ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſayd limited by ſome law, ſince the word reſtrained is of a harſh ſignification, and denotes ſomething of a certain force, the exerciſe of which this Author is altogether againſt in his whole trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Monarchy; ſo that putting it thus, that the ſupreme Power (in a limited Monarchy) muſt be limited by ſome Law, does not therefore place any coercive power above his, who can call him to an account for his actions: But a Power that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to him where he hath acted contrary to that Law, and may by that law puniſh, not the Monarch, but his Miniſters that have dared to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs thoſe ſuch known laws. For as for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch himſelf, it is ſtill ſuppoſed that he in his own perſon can do no injury: So that he may ſtill be Supreme, and yet be limited, not by any power Superior to his own, but by his laws (or declared Will) which he himſelf hath made in the Aſſembly of his Eſtates, and which he can not alter, but by the ſame form by which they were conſtituted; and this ſort of limitation may very well conſiſt with a perfect Monarchy. Thus the King of the <hi>Medaper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> was an abſolute Monarch, and alone made laws, and yet we find in <hi>Dan. XII.</hi> that <hi>Darius</hi> was forced againſt his will to caſt <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lyons Den,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50833:90"/> for tranſgreſſing his own Decree, becauſe the Laws of the <hi>Medo-Perſians</hi> did not alter, that it could not be diſpenſed with by the King, when they were once made: Thus it is no derogation to God himſelf to be bound by his own Oath, which from the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability and perfection of his nature he cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards alter. See <hi>Heb. VI.</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 16. to 17, 18. That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the two immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things are firſt his own nature, and then the Oath, he ſware by himſelf, ſo that we ſee this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of Gods power by his Oath (which is a law to him) is no derogation from his abſolute Monarchy or Omnipotency; but is conſiſtent with it; therefore it does not follow that in all laws where the law governs the Monarch, he hath therefore but a Gubernative power: Or that if the Soveraign Authority is limited by Law, it ceaſes to be Supreme, as I ſhall by and by ſhew more at large; in the mean time I ſhall not defend Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s opinion, when he ſaith that in a mixed Monarchy, the Soveraign Power muſt be originally in all the three Eſtates, or that the three Eſtates are all ſharers of the Supream Power, only the primity of ſhare in the Supream power is in one: For the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator obſerves very well that this contradicts what he before confeſſed, <hi>That the Power of Magiſtracy cannot well be divided; for it is one ſimple thing, or indiviſible beam of Divine perfection; yet he will for all this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his mixed Monarch but one ſhare of the Supream power, and gives other ſhares to the Eſtates; and ſo deſtroys the very being of Monarchy, by puting the Supream power, or a part of it in the whole body or a part thereof;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ſo far of their opinion that held, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power cannot well be divided into ſeveral ſhares, ſince there is ſo great a conjunction between
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50833:90"/> all the parts of Soveraign power, that one part cannot be ſeparated from the other, but it will ſpoil the regular form of the Government, and ſet up an irregular Commonwealth, which will ſcarce be able to hold well together. And that this will be ſo in all Governments, ſee what Mr. <hi>Pufendorf</hi> hath ſaid in that excellent work <hi>de Jure nature et Gentium</hi> diſcourſed upon this Subject; <note place="margin">

So likewiſe in that ſame place, <hi>If in the conferring of the royal power any thing be added, by which it may be underſtood that the King may be compelled, or puniſhed: For here it is true the Soveraignty is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but the people hath it indeed altogether;</hi> For if the People have a right of puniſhing the King upon any pretence whatever, there is nothing conferred upon him, but the office of the firſt Magiſtrate in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth under the name of King, but the Royal Power will ſtill remain in the People; becauſe (as I have already laid down) all puniſhment, <hi>quatenus</hi> as ſuch, muſt proceed from a Superior: But all compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50833:91"/> is performed two ways, either morally, or Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that is by way of Soveraign Authority, or by force of Arms, or War; for there is no Authority can be morally ſuppoſed againſt an Equal, conſidered as ſuch; therefore when <hi>Grotius</hi> inferrs, that the People may be at leaſt equal to the King, becauſe in ſome caſes it may compel him, he is likewiſe neceſſitated to grant that neither of them hath any Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the other, becauſe it contradicts the nature of a Commonwealth: Though compulſion by force of Armes as between Equals, or thoſe who have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over each other, muſt be granted in the ſtate of nature, in which we will make uſe of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s own Example; that a Creditor hath naturally a right of compelling the Debtor to pay his debts, although the Creditor hath no right to exact this of him by way of any authority thereby veſted in himſelf: otherways it were neceſſary that every one who owed another any thing, muſt preſently come under his power: therefore the Debtor muſt be compelled by the Creditor to pay his debt, either by the aſſiſtance of ſome Judge (which cannot be ſuppoſed between the King and People) or if they live in a natural liberty, by force. But if we ſhould allow this way of compulſion to the People, it will follow that both the King and the People do ſtill live in a natural liberty, or meer ſtate of nature; that is that the Commonwealth, is diſſolved: Yet we will grant <hi>Grotius</hi> this, that in all civil conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there is nothing abſolutely free from ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, therefore becauſe of the inconveniencies that ariſe from this divided Soveraignty, it does not preſently follow that there can be no ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or that it muſt preſently fall to an abſolute Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; for right is not to be meaſured from what pleaſes either this, or that Author, but from his or their will, from whom this right at firſt began. So likewiſe on the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50833:91"/> other ſide, it muſt be granted that if ſuch diviſion of the Supreme Authority hath been inſtituted by any People that people have not conſtituted a Regular government but a politick body ſubject to perpetual diſtempers.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſuppoſing the moſt that can be required, that the King in a limited Monarchy is he who alone gives the Eſſence and Authority to the Laws, though he can make no other than what are offered him in the Aſſembly of his Eſtates; yet if all Magiſtrates that put theſe Laws in execution are ſubordinate to him, and depend upon him, this takes away that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience this Author objects againſt limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs: For he is truely Supreme, ſince he makes the laws, and is the Fountain of all power in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; neither does this derogate from the Supremacy of his Power that he is obliged either by original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or by after promiſe, or condeſcent not to make any laws, or to levy any mony, or taxes from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but what they ſhall offer him in the Aſſembly of his Eſtates. For ſince all laws that are made in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, are but the declaration of the Monarchs will: and that he being but one man cannot declare his will Phyſically to the ſences of all his Subjects, but requires ſome politick form, or manner of ſignifying this will to all that are to obey it, which is various accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeveral Cuſtoms, and conſtitutions of divers Kingdoms; therefore as in Monarchies where there are no uſe of Letters, Laws can be no otherwiſe made, or promulgated, but by ſignifying the Monarchs will to the ſubordinate Magiſtrates by word of mouth, by ſuch Officers as muſt be ſuppoſed to bring ſome ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient token, that they come immediately from them, and are ſufficiently inſtructed in the matter he will have obſerved as a law, which form can depend upon nothing but Cuſtom, or the common conſent of the People to admit that for Law which ſhall be ſo
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50833:92"/> promulgated, ſince they have no infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that the Meſſenger may be ſent by ſome body elſe that hath a mind to make alterations in the State without the Princes knowledge; or elſe that the Meſſenger may miſtake the Princes mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and report the law wrong. So likewiſe in Kingdoms where laws are put into writing, there muſt be ſome form, or rule agreed upon, both of making, and promulgating Laws: So likewiſe in thoſe we call limited Monarchies, the Cuſtom or form is not to admit any thing for a Law, or the authentick will of the Prince, but what his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have offered to him drawn up into form, and which he hath paſſed into a Law, by ſome token of conſent before inſtituted in the preſence of the general Aſſembly of the Eſtates of his Kingdom: which courſe is abſolutely the beſt both for the Prince and People; For ſince the end of all laws (as of Government it ſelf) are the good of the people; ſo it is not likely that the Subjects having the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Laws, will offer any to the Prince that they are not abſolutely perſwaded are for the benefit of the Commonwealth, nor can that be any prejudice to the Prince's power, ſince no law can be made unleſs he give it the ſtamp of his Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Therefore though Forms are not eſſential to the declareing of the will of a private man in the ſtate of nature, yet they muſt be in reſpect of that of ſuch a Prince, ſince the power of the former is natural and can influence only thoſe that hear him, but that of a Prince is artificial, or political as proceeding from compact, and is to command even thoſe that never ſaw him, or are like to come into his preſence; it is requiſite that the ways of declaring his will be made ſo certain, that the Subjects may have no reaſon to doubt of it: therefore there can no way
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50833:92"/> be found out which can more certainly aſſure all the Subjects both of the benefit, and Authority of the Laws, than when a Prince voluntarily in a general Aſſembly of all the Eſtates of his Kingdom, either by pronouncing of words, or by touching the Bills offered him with his royal Scepter, (or any ſuch like Ceremony) declares he will have thoſe Bills, or Writings promulgated and obſerved as his Laws, or declared Will, which being once done in ſuch a ſolemn and publick manner, takes away all ſuſpition that the Prince was not well adviſed when he made them, or wrought upon by the flateries or inſinuations of Women or Favourites; Circumſtances which being wanting in abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, where the Prince's Edicts are perhaps either given out in haſt, or at ſecond hand to thoſe who never ſee him, by <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> or Officers; who taking the Monarch at ſome advantage, and makes him paſs Commands which perhaps he does not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or repents of the next day; whereas in ſuch a limited Monarchy, a Prince does not only appear with greater Splendor and Authority, when in the face of his Subjects he exerciſes the higheſt Act of Soveraignty in making laws, but likewiſe aſſures them that he acts with an abſolute freedom, when having a liberty to deny, he yet grants the deſires of his Subjects; yet ſo eſtabliſhes them for Laws, that they cannot be altered without their conſents, and by the ſame means by which they were firſt made: which being ſuppoſed may ſerve to anſwer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that ſome may make, that if this way of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Laws, or the Princes declaring his will after this manner be but a matter of form, or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, why may not this Monarch alter it at his pleaſure, and declare for the future (for example) that all laws ſhall be by him paſſed in his privy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50833:93"/> Council, and then being openly proclamed, and Copies recorded in all Courts of Juſtice, ſhall be of the ſame Authority as if they had been paſſed in the Aſſembly of Eſtates: To which the anſwer is obvious, that though it is true the Monarchs paſſing of Laws, whether in the great Council, or in his privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil be but a matter of form, if the Legiſlative power remain wholly in himſelf; yet ſince even the forms, and Circumſtances in doing things are ſuch eſſential things without which buſineſs cannot be done; If therefore the people made it part of their original Contract with their Prince at firſt, that he ſhould make no laws, but what ſhould be of their propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and drawing up; and that he might refuſe if he pleaſed the whole, but ſhould not alter any part of it: This though in its ſelf a matter of form, yet being at firſt ſo agreed is indeed an original and fundamental conſtitution of the Government. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Author is as much miſtaken in his Divinity as his Law, when <hi>Patriarcha P.</hi> 97. Reſolves the queſtion in the affirmative, <hi>Whether it be a ſin for a Subject to diſobey the King if he command any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Laws, That the Subject ought to break the laws</hi> if his King command him: Where as as the Author hath put it, nothing is more contrary to Law and Reaſon, for ſo it would be no ſin for Souldiers or others, to give and take away mens Goods by force, or turn them out of their houſes, if they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Kings Commiſſion for it; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was no ſin in thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebells that acted by a counterfeit Commiſſion under Sr. <hi>Philim O Neal;</hi> for though it was forged (yet the forgery being known but to very few) it was in reſpect of thoſe who acted by vertue thereof all one, as if it had been true and according to this Authors Divinity, <note place="margin">

I ſee not why this may not in one ſenſe be called a ſecond original conſtitution; for he was at firſt an abſolute King by which was the original conſtitution, and his coming to new Terms with them may be termed in reſpect of this a ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary original conſtitution, or agreement, of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment though founded upon the former old right which the Monarch had to govern: as for a King by Conqueſt, it cannot indeed in reſpect of him be properly called a ſecundary conſtitution, ſince the Conquerour had no right to clame an abſolute ſubjection from the Subjects until they ſubmitted to him, ſo as that they might not drive him out again, if they were able, until he came to ſome Terms with them. Thus I think no ſober man but will maintain, that the people of <hi>England</hi> might lawfully have driven out <hi>William I.</hi> (called the Conquerour) ſuppoſing he had claimed by no other title but Conqueſt alone, which when he had ſworn to obſerve and maintain all the Laws, and liberties

And certainly had he not thought his title by Conqueſt not ſo good as the other of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Teſtament; he would never have quitted the former and ſworn to obſerve the Laws of his Predeceſſor; ſo likewiſe <hi>Henry I.</hi>

It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true which this Author affirms, that this accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſo much power as the people pleaſed to give him, ſince they neither deſired, nor did he grant them any more but thoſe juſt rights they had long before enjoyed under their former Kings before his Father's coming into <hi>England.</hi> However I conceive this wiſe Prince was of the opinion of <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi>

In <hi>Macedon</hi> the Kings deſcended of <hi>Caranus</hi> (as <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> ſays in <hi>Arrian</hi>) did obtain an Empire over the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> not by force but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

VI. The Army by an antient cuſtom of the Macedonians did judg of Capital cauſes</hi> (i. e. <hi>in time of War</hi>) <hi>but in peace it belonged to the People:</hi> the power of their Kings ſignified litle, unleſs his Authority was before of ſome force. And this was by original conſtitution, for we do not find that ever the Kings of <hi>Macedon</hi> altered any thing in their original conſtitution; yet they had the Soveraignty in moſt things; and their perſons were ſacred. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe among the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> where <hi>Romulus</hi> from a Captain of Volunteers, became a King. <hi>Dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius Halicar: Lib. II.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50833:96"/> Commands; concluding that he thought it an Honour for him to have been declared the Leader of ſo great a Colony, and to have a City called by his name.</hi> Whereupon the people after ſome deliberation among themſelves choſe him their King, or limited Monarch, ſince both the Senate and people had from the very beginning their particular ſhares in the Government, the Senates making this great Counſel (which yet were for the greater part of them choſen out of the <hi>Patricians</hi> by the Tribes, <note place="margin">

But becauſe theſe examples may ſeem too ſtale, or remote, Let us now conſider all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that have been erected upon the ruins of the Roman Empire by thoſe Northern Nations that over-ran it; and ſee if there were ſo much as one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom among them that was not limited: As for the Kingdoms of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> erected in <hi>Italy Africk,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the Author confeſſes they were

And as for the Kingdoms erected by Francks in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Gaule,</hi> which we now call German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> As for the former any one that willread the ancient French, and German Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, will find that the Kings of <hi>Germany</hi> could not do any thing of Moment, not ſo much as declare a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor without the conſent of their Great Counſell of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Clergy, and as to the latter as abſolute as it ſeems at preſent, it was a few ages paſt, almoſt as much limited, if not more than its Neighbours: For the Kings of <hi>France</hi> could not anciently make Laws, raiſe any publick War, wherein the Nobility, and people were bound to aſſiſt him, or Levy Taxes upon their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects without the conſent of the Eſtates; but thoſe Aſſemblies being at firſt diſcontinued by reaſon of the continual wars which <hi>Henry V.</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VI.</hi>

So likewiſe in the ſame Chapter ſpeaking of thoſe who were againſt the Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Eſtates at that time; that there were ſome (but thoſe neither conſiderable for quality or vertue) who ſaid that it was a diminution to the Kings Authority to talk of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Eſtates, and no leſs than Treaſon againſt him. But it is they themſelves who commit that crime againſt God,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50833:98"/> the King, and their Country, and thoſe who uſe theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are ſuch as are in Authority without deſert, unfit for any thing but flattery, whiſpering trifles and ſtories in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ears of their Maſters, which makes them apprehenſive of theſe Aſſemblies, leſt they ſhould take cognizance of them, and their manners.</hi> But I ſuppoſe it was for ſuch honeſt expreſſions as theſe, that <hi>Katherine de Midices</hi> Queen of <hi>France</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Comines</hi> had made as many Hereticks in Politicks, as <hi>Calvin</hi> had done in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is becauſe he open'd Mens Eyes, and made them underſtand a little of that they call King-craft. But however in ſome Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> as in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> though the King is never denyed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſe to demand; yet they ſtill retain ſo much of the ſhadow of their antient Liberties as not to be taxed without the conſent of the. Aſſembly of Eſtates conſiſting of the Nobility, Clergy, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of great Towns, and Cities, which however is ſome eaſe to them, not to have their mony taken by Edict. So <hi>Hungary,</hi> which was erected by the <hi>Huns,</hi> a ſtirp of the European <hi>Scythians,</hi> by which you may judge the antient form of Government was much the ſame as that of the <hi>Germanes.</hi> All Hiſtories grant that Kingdom to have been limited, and to be of the ſame form with that of the other Northern Nations, nay which is more, to have had a Palatine, who could hinder the King from ordaining any thing contrary to the Laws: and as for <hi>Poland,</hi> the Author cannot deny but it is limited in many things; but as he only takes notice of thoſe things in which the King hath power, ſo he omits moſt of thoſe in which he hath none, as in raiſing of mony, or making laws without the conſent of the Diet. So likewiſe in <hi>Denmark</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf cannot deny but that Kingdom is limited, for he could not before the late war with <hi>Sweden</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make War or Peace, raiſe mony or make laws without the conſent of his Senate, who were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50833:98"/> repreſentative of all the Nobility. But for the Election of a new King, or for the making of new Laws the whole body of the Nobility, and Clergy were to be preſent and conſent. As for <hi>Scotland</hi> the Government of it hath alwayes ſo much reſembled <hi>England,</hi> that it being now the ſame Prince, I ſhall not ſay more of it, but that it hath alwayes been a limited, if not a mixt Government. In <hi>Sweden</hi> the Kings power is much the ſame, only the Commons have repreſentatives in the aſſembly of Eſtates, which they had not in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> But in <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> the Kings (until of Late that they became Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary) were never received or owned as Lawful, until they were Crown'd and had Sworn to obſerve and maintaine the Laws of the Kingdom and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Nobility and People. But the Authour thinks he hath gotten a great advantage, <hi>becauſe he finds that in</hi> Poland <hi>and</hi> Denmark, <hi>the Commons have no repreſentatives in the Aſſembly of Eſtates, and that therefore in ſome limited Monarchies the whole Community in its underived Majeſty do not ever convene to Juſtice.</hi> Which ſignifie little, for theſe that are now the Nobility may be Heirs to thoſe that once had the whole propriety of the Country in their hands, when theſe Kingdoms were erected; and ſo tho the body of the People encreaſed, yet the ancient Nobility never admitted them into a ſhare of the Government. As in <hi>Venice</hi> without doubt all the Ancient Planters of thoſe Iſlands had Votes in the Government, and it was then popular, though it is now reſtrained to the ancient Families, or thoſe new ones they now admit, and is much ſuch an other cavil as that in <hi>England:</hi> Before the reduceing the <hi>Nobiles Minores</hi> to two Knights of the Shire, the Commons had no Votes in the great Council, or Parliament, which opinion ſee confuted in Mr. <hi>Petyt's</hi> Treatiſe of the ancient Rights of the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in the learned Treatiſe, call'd <hi>Jani Anglorum
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50833:99"/> facies nova.</hi> And this appears more plainly in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> where every Lord of a Mannor, or Territory is a Nobleman, and hath a Vote in the Diet or Aſſembly of the Eſtates, or elſe it might have begun as in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is but an Aſſociation of ſo many petty Princes for mutual defence, under an Elective Head, who when they entred into this Confederac, reſerved to themſelves the power they had before over their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Vaſſals: which how abſolute that was, any man may find, that underſtands the <hi>Sclavonians</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, in ſo much that from the abſolute Subjection of that People to their Lords we have the Word SLAVE to this day: But the Author himſelf confeſſes the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Poland</hi> to be limited, but it is only by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; who are for all this forced to pleaſe the King, and to ſecond his will to avoid diſcord, which is very true, and is requiſite in all limited Governments, that the King, Nobility, and People ſhould agree, and as it is their duty to comply with his deſires, as much as may be, without giving up their liberties, lives, and fortunes, abſolutely to his diſpoſal: So it is his, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Peoples deſires in all things which are for their benefit: Not that I praiſe the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Poland,</hi> ſince of all thoſe that own the name of King, I am ſo far of the Authors mind as to think it moſt liable to Civil Diſſentions. But before I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs this Subject, I muſt take notice of a miſtake in the laſt Page of this Authors preſent Treatiſe which is that the People or Community in all theſe three Realms are as abſolute Vaſſals as any in the world, which is not true, unleſs it be affirmed of the Vilains Or Vaſſals of the Nobility, which is granted are more abſolute Vilains, than ours were in <hi>England,</hi> but as for the free born, <note place="margin">See Pontanus Hiſt. Dan. ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus de Stat.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50833:99"/> priviledges; and are free, both their Perſons, and Fortunes, and cannot be oppreſſed by the Nobility, nor taxed but by the Dyet or Aſſembly of Eſtates: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Authors Friends may now cavil, and ſay that theſe are no Monarchies at all, becauſe a Monarchy is the Government of one alone, in which neither Nobility nor People have any ſhare; to which I ſhall ſay no more then that theſe People call their Governments Monarchies, as participating more of that then any other forme; and they are owned to be true Kings all the world over; and if the Gentlemen of the Authours opinion will quarrel about words, my buſineſs is not to diſpute from Grammar but reaſon; ſo that theſe Kingdoms may be called Monarchies as they are in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> but if theſe Gentlemen think it not fit to call them ſo, let them conſider how much all this Authors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will concerne our Government in <hi>England;</hi> or elſewhere in <hi>Europe.</hi> Having now taken a ſhort view of the Ancient Governments of moſt of the Moderne Kingdoms that have been erected ſince the ruin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; we will conclude with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our own Countrey, and inquire whether ever it were an abſolute deſpotick Monarchy or no. As for the Original of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Government, it is evident out of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and other Authours, that the Ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> from whom our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors deſcended, and of which Nation they were a part, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew what belonged to an abſolute deſpotick power in their Princes. And after the <hi>Saxons</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> having been erected in this Iſland, the Ancient form of Government was not altered, as I ſhall prove by and by; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Monkiſh Writers of thoſe times, have been ſhort and obſcure, in that which is moſt material in a Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> the form of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and manner of ſucceſſion to the Crown amongſt them; ſtuffing up their books with unneceſſary ſtories
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50833:100"/> of miracles, and foundations of Churches, and Abbeys: Yet ſo much is to be pickt out of them, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> which was that on which our Monarchy is grafted, was not deſpotical, but limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Laws, that the King could not ſeiſe mens lands or goods without Proceſs; that he could not make Laws without the conſent of his <hi>Wittena Gemote,</hi> or Great Counſel: Nor take away mens lives, without a Legal trial by their Peers, <note place="margin">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50833:101"/> much admire it, let them go find it by the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> or <hi>Ganges</hi> where the Sun (that late Emblem of univerſal Monarchy) is ſo indulgent to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he produces, that thoſe which he cannot make grow here beyond an <hi>Eut,</hi> or <hi>Adder,</hi> are there made Crocodiles, and Serpents that devour a man at a bit. So that if you ſhould ſtile them the repreſentatives of the Monarchs of thoſe Climates, Travellers will ſay you do not wrong them. I ſhall now proceed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the moſt material Objection of this Authors, and not imitate him who in this Treatiſe paſſes by all the Arguments which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> brings to prove that this is no abſolute deſpotick, but at leaſt a limited Monarchy, as ſilently as Commentators do hard places that puzle them. Let us therefore look back to his Patriarcha, where he gives us a diſtinction of the School-men,<q rend="inline">'whereby they ſubject Kings to the directive, but not to the coactive power of Laws, and is a confeſſion that Kings are not bound by the poſitive Laws of any Nation: Since the compulſory power of Laws of that which properly makes Laws to be Laws, by binding men by rewards and puniſhments to obedience; whereas the direction of the Law, is but like the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and direction which the Kings Councel gives the King, which no man ſays is a Law to the King.</q> Igrant this diſtinction, provided the Author will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe admit another, that though the King is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by Laws, or to any Judges of them as to Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; or as to the compulſory Power of them: Yet in reſpect of God, and his own Conſcience, he is ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obſerve them, and not to diſpence with them in thoſe caſes which the Law does not give him a power ſo to do; and ſince it is true that it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments annext that give laws their Sanction, therefore there are certain rewards which will naturally bleſs Princes that keep their Laws, ſuch as peace of Conſcience, Security, the affections of their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50833:102"/> People <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if I call the contrary effects to theſe natural puniſhments, that are commonly the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the breach of them, I think I ſhould not ſpeak abſurdly; ſince the Author himſelf tells us <hi>P.</hi> 93. <hi>Albeit Kings who make the Laws, are (as King</hi> James <hi>there teacheth us) above Laws, yet will they rule their Subjects by the Law, and a King governing in a ſetled Kingdom leaves to be a King &amp; degenerates into a Tyrant ſo ſoon as he ſeems to rule</hi> (it is there printed in the Copy <hi>according,</hi> which is nonſence) <hi>contrary to his Laws:</hi> and certainly a Tyrant can never promiſe himſelf ſecurity, either from his own Conſcience, or from Men; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſays the direction of the Law is only like the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which the Kings Councel gives him, which no man ſays is a Law to him, is falſe; for the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel ſhould never adviſe him to do that which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not whith a ſafe Conſcience perform; but the Kings Conſcience can never adviſe him to break thoſe Laws that are the boundaries between his Prerogatives, and the Peoples juſt Rights; and therefore though it is true in ſome caſes where the King ſees the Law ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, or doubtful, he may mitigate or interpret the Execution thereof by his Judges, to whom he hath made over that power in the intervalls of Parliament, and though perhaps ſome particular Statutes may be his Authority be ſuſpended, for cauſes beſt known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Council; Yet this does not extend to Laws of publick concernment: and for that I will appeal to the Conſcience of any true Son of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whether he thinks (for Example) that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for indulgence contrary to the Statute made againſt Conventicles were binding or no: Neither is this that follows conſiſtent with what the Author hath ſaid before: <hi>That although a King do frame all his Actions to be according to the Laws, yet he is not bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to but at his good will, and for good Example, or ſo far forth as the general Law of the ſafety of the Commonwealth doth naturally bind him; For in ſuch ſort only poſitive Laws may
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50833:102"/> may be ſaid to bind the King, not by being poſitive, but as they are naturally the beſt, and only means for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Common-wealth!</hi> So that if a King thinks any, the firmeſt and moſt indiſpenſible Laws that have been made, (ſuppoſe, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the Statute <hi>de Tallagio non concedendo</hi> for example) not to be for the ſafety of the Commonweal, it is but his declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he will have them no longer obſerved, and the work is done, nor will this that follows help it, though true, <hi>that all Kings even Tyrants and Conquerors are bound to preſerve the Lands, Goods, Liberties and lives of all their Subjects, not by any Municipal Laws ſo much as the natural Law of a Father, which binds them to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Acts of their Fore-Fathers, and Predeceſſors in things neceſſary for the publick Good of the Subjects.</hi>

               <p>All which is very well, but if this Monarch thus ſucceeding in the place of the natural Father, is the ſole Judge of what things are neceſſary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, what if he have a mind to keep theſe Children (for Children, and ſubjects, ſlaves are all one with this Authour) as ſome unnatural Fathers do, as cheap as they can, or to make the moſt of them, will let them enjoy no more but the ſcanty neceſſaries of life; and will think fair water, brown bread and wooden ſhooes ſufficient for a Farmer, and 300 <hi>l.</hi> or 400 <hi>l. per annum</hi> enough in Conſcience for a Country Gentleman, or deſiring to be abſolute, (and therefore to have a conſtant ſtanding Army to raiſe mony with) as ſome Monarchs do, and being reſolved that for the future all the juſt rights and priviledges of his Clergy Nobility and People ſhall ſignifie nothing, will take all the over-plus of his Childrens Eſtates, eaving them no more then a poor and miſerable ſubſiſtence, he may lawfully do what he will with his own, and it is all his upon the firſt intimation of his pleaſure by Edict, or Proclamation: But perhaps ſome honeſt Divine may ſtart up and tell him he will be damned for thus abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his power, or breaking his Coronation Oath: what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50833:103"/> What if this Father of his people ſhall laugh at him for a fool, and think himſelf too cunning to believe any ſuch thing, or what if his Son, or Succeſſor be reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to run his head any more into the ſnare of a Coronation Oath, but finding himſelf inveſted in all the abſolute power of his Predeceſſour without any unjuſt act of his own (ſince we know Princes ſeldome looſe any thing they have once got) will exerciſe it as he pleaſes for his own humour or glory, and thinks himſelf not obliged in Conſcience to reſtore any of thoſe rights his Predeceſſor hath urſuped upon his People. I know not what benefit this may be to the Prince, but this I am ſure of; it would very little mend the Subjects condition to be told their former Monarch was damned, or that this may follow him; when they are now ſlaves, nor is this a mere <hi>Chimera</hi> ſince a Neighbouring people over againſt us, loſt their liberties by much ſuch a kind of proceeding. <hi>And therefore this Authour hath found out a very fit interpretation of the Kings Coronation Oath, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Iuramenta Regis quando coronatur old Stat. ed</hi> 1556.</note> for whereas he uſed to Swear that he will cauſe equal and upright juſtice to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in all his judgments, and to uſe diſcretion with mercy, and truth according to his power, and that the juſt Laws and cuſtomes</hi> (quas vulgus elegerit) I will not tranſlate it <hi>ſhall chuſe to be obſerved,</hi> to the honour of God. Yet our Author will have the King obliged to keep no laws but what he in his diſcretion Judges to be upright, which is to make the Oath ſignifie juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as I have proved already, wherein he abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably perverts the ſenſe of this Oath, for that which he puts firſt is really laſt. And the words by which he Swears to obſerve the Laws, and cuſtomes, granted by King <hi>Edward,</hi> and other his Predeceſſors, are abſolute, and without any reſervation, or reſtriction; and as for the laſt clauſe where the King Swears to obſerve and protect <hi>juſtas Leges, &amp; conſuetudines.</hi> (which he tranſlates upright Laws and cuſtomes) this word <hi>juſtas</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:50833:103"/> in this place is not put reſtrictively (as any man may ſee that conſiders the ſenſe of the words) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of Epithite ſuppoſing that the People would not chuſe any laws to be obſerved, but thoſe that are juſt, and upright, but the Author omits here <hi>quas popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Elegerit,</hi> as a ſentence that does not at all pleaſe him; though it be in all the Copies of the old Coronation. Oaths of our Kings: and he may as well deny that they tooke any other clauſe, as this: yet ſince the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf gives us an interpretation of theſe words in his Freeholders inqueſt, <hi>pag.</hi> 62. which will by his own ſhowing make theſe clauſes <hi>juſtas Leges, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudines,</hi> not to extend to all laws and cuſtomes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but thoſe <hi>quas vulgus elegerit,</hi> that is as he there interprets it the Cuſtomes which the vulgar <hi>ſhall chuſe, and it is the vulgus or common people only who chuſe cuſtomes, common uſage time out of mind creates a cuſtome, no where can ſo common a uſage be found as among the vulgar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If a cuſtome be common through the whole Kingdom, it is all one with the common law in</hi> England, which is ſaid to be common cuſtome; that in plain terms to maintain the cuſtomes which the vulgar ſhall chuſe, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws of <hi>England,</hi> ſo that in the Authours own ſenſe it ſhall not ſignifie ſuch Laws which the King himſelf hath already choſen, and eſtabliſht, but only thoſe which the people have choſen, and in this ſenſe perhaps it was part of the Oath of <hi>Richard</hi> II. to aboliſh all evil, unjuſt Laws; that is, evil vulgar cuſtomes, and to aboliſh them whenever they ſhould be offred him by bill. But I do not read that any King or Queen ſince <hi>Richard</hi> II. took that clauſe he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and perhaps King <hi>Richard</hi> took it in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours ſenſe, and found ſuch interpreters to his mind, and that made him prove ſuch a King as he was, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy all the Laws and liberties of this Nation, burning and cancelling the Records of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and indeed there was no need of any, if it be true which he did not ſtick to affirme, <hi>that the Laws of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50833:104"/> of</hi> England <hi>were only to be found in his head, or his breaſt; but the Authour though he grants (for it were undutiful to contradict ſo wiſe a King as King</hi> James,) <hi>that a King Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning in a ſetled Kingdom, leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant ſo ſoon as he ſeems to rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Laws,</hi> yet will by no means have this King counted a Tyrant. But I will not trouble my ſelf about trifles, much leſs maintaine that the Lords or Commons had any Authority to uſe King <hi>Richard</hi> as they did; ſince it is a contradiction that any power ſhould Judge that, on which it depends and who die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is immediatly diſſolved, ſince our Kings have ever been truſted with the Prerogative of calling and diſſolving Parliaments, and certainly they can never be ſuppoſed to let them ſit to depoſe themſelves. And of this opinion was <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Si autem ab eo petatur cum (breve non currat contra ipſum) Locus erit ſupplicationi, quod factum ſuum corrigat &amp; emendat, quod ſi non fecerit, ſatis ſufficit ei ad paenam, quod Dominum expectet ultorem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return where we left off, if it be granted that Kings do Swear to obſerve all the laws of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, yet this Author is ſo good a caſuiſt, that he can as eaſily abſolve their Conſciences as the Pope himſelf; <hi>For ſays he, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Patriarch p.</hi> 97.</note> no man can think it reaſon that Kings ſhould be more bound by their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Oaths then Common perſons are by theirs, now if apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man make a contract, either with or without an Oath, he is no farther bound then the equity and juſtice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ties him; for a man may have relief againſt an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and unjuſt promiſe, if either deceit or Errour or force or fear induced him thereunto: Or if it be hurtful or grievous in the performance; and ſince the Laws in many caſes give the King a Prerogative above common Perſons, I ſee</hi> no reaſon why he ſhould be denyed that Priviledg which the meaneſt of his Subjects doth enjoy.</p>
               <p>I know not to what end the Author writ this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grph, unleſs it were to make the world beleive, that when
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50833:104"/> when Kings take their Coronation Oaths they do it not freely; but only are drawn in, by the Biſhops, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by the great Lords; that they do not underſtand what they do, and ſo are meerly chouſed, or frighted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by Fraud, or Force. A very fine excuſe for a Prince for ſo ſolemn an action, and which he hath had time enough to conſider of, and adviſe with his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether he may take it or no: That he can be ſaid to be induced by Fear or Force, who was a lawful King before, and only uſes this ceremony to let his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſee the reallity of his intentions towards them. And that nothing ſhall prevail with him to break his Oath which he hath made before God. That he will preſerve thoſe Laws and rights of his Subjects, which he does not grant but find them in poſſeſſion of: But as for this relief againſt an unreaſonable, or unjuſt promiſe as the Author terms it. If by thoſe words he means a promiſe, or grant that may tend to ſome damage, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of the Promiſer or Grantor, to ſome right or Juriſdiction that the Grantor might have enjoyed, had it not been granted away, either by his Anceſtors, or himſelf; If the Promiſe were full, and perfect, or the grant not obtained either by fear, force, or Fraud; all Civilians, and Divines hold that the Promiſer, or Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is obliged to the Promiſe, and cannot take away the thing granted, though it were in his power ſo to do. For <hi>David</hi> makes it part of the Character of the upright man, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal. XV.</hi> 4.</note> and who ſhall dwell in Gods Tabernacle, that ſweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. But our Author hath found a way to ſet all men looſe from their Oaths, or contracts if they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing grievous, or hurtful in the performance, that is if the Promiſer, or Grantor think it ſo: and Kings muſt have at leaſt as much, and in moſt caſes a greater Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative than common Perſons. <q rend="inline">'It was a thouſand pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties this Author was not Confeſſor to King <hi>H.

               <p>But I come now to the laſt main Objection which the Author makes againſt limited Monarchy; and by which he hopes to prove it an abſolute Monarchy: I will ſet down the difference between our Author, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> upon whom he animadverts in their own words. <q rend="inline">'Firſt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> holds that the King himſelf in a limited Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is not to be reſiſted or puniſhed any more then in abſolute Monarchy, and ſo can doe no wrong in his own perſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Yet if he this limited Monarch tranſcends his bounds, if he commands againſt Law, the ſubject is not Legally bound to obedience in ſuch caſes, whereupon our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor asks who ſhall be Judge, whether the Monarch tranſcend his bounds? Mr. <hi>H.</hi> conceives that in a limited legal Monarchy, there can be no ſtated external Judge of the Monarch's actions, if there grow a fundamental variance betwixt him, and the Community. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place confeſſes that there can be no Judge Legal, and conſtituted within that form of Government, whereupon the Author thinks he hath got a great advantage over our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and therefore is reſolved to put the queſtion home, and demands of him if there be a variance betwixt the Monarch, and any of the meaneſt perſons of the community who ſhall be judg? for inſtance, the King commands or gives Judgment againſt me: I reply his commands are illegal, and his Judgments not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law: who muſt judge? if the Monarch himſelf judge, then you deſtroy the frame of the Government, and make it abſolute: For ſaith Mr <hi>H.</hi> to confine a Monarch to a Law, and then to make him Judge of his own deviations
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50833:105"/> from that Law, is to obſolve him from all Law, and on the other ſide, if any or all the People may Judg, then you put the Soveraignty in the whole Body, or part of it, and deſtroy the Being of Monarchy, and thus this Author (ſays Sir <hi>R. A.</hi>) hath caught himſelf in a plain Dilemma: if the King be Judg, then he is no limited Monarch, if the people Judg, then he is no Monarch at all: ſo farewell limited Monarchy, nay farewell all Government if there be no Judg.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But as ſure as this Author thinks he hath his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary at an Advantage, <hi>yet I do not ſee that he hath given him ſo much as a Foyl, much leſs a fair Fall,</hi> for all this terrible Dilemma. For firſt, it is for this, that if the people be Judg when the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are unlawful, it will therefore deſtroy the being of Monarchy; ſuppoſe a King ſhould command all his Subjects to go to Maſs, which they being Proteſtants judg Idolatrous. If they obey him, they muſt commit Idolatry, if they diſobey him he is then no Monarch. But perhaps it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that it is true, the Subjects may judg when the Command is unlawful, but if they cannot yield active obedience, yet they muſt yield a paſſive one, and ſubmit patiently to the Penalties he pleaſes to lay upon them for not going. This Anſwer will not ſerve turn, for the Authors Objection is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, if the people judg, (he does not ſay reſiſt) he is no Monarch at all: and refuſing to go to Maſs is a judging the Princes Command unlawful. But Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> from whom this Argument is borrowed, drives it more home, (if the Authors friends will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Conſequence) &amp; affirms truely upon his own principles, that if the Subject do judg in any caſe whatever, of what is lawful or unlawful, good or evil, it quite deſtroys the Monarchy. For the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50833:106"/> is ſole Judg of all Actions, whether they be Lawſul or not. Now when the Monarch hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Will, that all his Subjects ſhould go to Maſs, ſurely not to go, is to diſobey the Monarchs Command. Since his will was, they ſhould abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go to Maſs, nor leave it to their diſcretion either to go to Maſs, or undergo the Penalty ordained for not going. Laſtly, neither does the Judgment of the people concerning their own ſafty, in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, take away the abſolute power of a Monarch. For a General of an Army hath an abſolute Power over the Lives of his Soldiers but does it derogate from his abſolute power, that he knowes he ſhall not be obeyed if he command his Men to leap down a Precipice, or to kill each other?</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> propoſes two or three expedients to help this inconvenience of the want of a publick Judg. Firſt. He ſays a Subject is bound to yield to a Magiſtrate, where he cannot <hi>de jure</hi> challeng obedience, if it be in a thing in which he can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do it without ſubverſion to the Goverment, and in which his Act may not be made a leading Caſe, and ſo bring on a preſcription againſt public liberty. And again, he ſaith, If the Act in which the Exorbitance, or Tranſgreſſion of the Monarch is ſuppoſed to be, be of leſſer moment, and not ſtriking at the very Being of the Government, it ought to be borne by publick patience,</q> rather then to endanger the Being of the State. But theſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voes however moderate and ſober, will not pleaſe our Author at all. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anarchy</hi> 285.</note> 
                  <q rend="inline">'For he will have them to be but Fig-leaves to cover the nakedneſs of Mr. H's limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch formed upon weak ſuppoſals in caſes of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer moment. For if the Monarch be to govern only according to Law, no tranſgreſſion of his
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50833:106"/> can be of no ſmall moment, if he break the bounds of Law; for it is a ſubverſion of the Government it ſelf, and may be a leading caſe, and ſo bring on a preſcription againſt publick Liberty; and ſtrikes at the very being of the Government it ſelf; and let the caſe be never ſo ſmall, yet if there be ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality in the Act, it ſtrikes at the very being of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy, which is to be legal, unleſs the Author will ſay, as in effect he doth, that his limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Monarch muſt govern according to Law, in great &amp; publick matters only, but that in ſmaller, and which concern private Men, he may rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All which, although it look fine, yet examined to the bottom ſignifies little, for it is not true, that every the leaſt tranſgreſſion of the bounds of Law, is a ſubverſion of the Government it ſelf, ſince if done perhaps only to one or a few perſons, it does not follow that therefore it muſt be a leading caſe, and ſo bring on a preſcription againſt publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in all caſes. Neither does the Subjects bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it not contribute otherwiſe then acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to this breach of Liberty. Since he is obliged to bear it, not becauſe it is juſt, but becauſe he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may hope to have redreſs by the ordinary courſe of Law, or elſe by petitioning the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Eſtates, when they meet, who are partly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained on purpoſe to remonſtrate the Grievances of Subjects to their Prince, and thereupon, to have them redreſſed. Nor is this limited Monarch (as the Author would infer) leſs obliged to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, in ſmaller or private matters, then in great and publick ones. Only in many ſmaller matters, Princes or their Officers may through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or inadvertency ſometimes tranſgreſs the true bounds of Law, which they would not do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50833:107"/> if they were better informed. And ſo likewiſe if the Subject bear it, it is not from the Legality of the Act, but from this great Maxime in Law and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that a miſchief to ſome private men, is better than an inconvenience in giving every private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon power, that thinks himſelf injured by the Prince or his Officers, to be his own Judg and right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by force; ſince that were contrary to the great duty of every good Subject of endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the common peace and happineſs of his Country, which ought to be preferred before any private mans Intereſt. So on the other ſide if the oppreſſion or breach of Laws be general, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all the People alike: if the reaſon of the caſe alter, why may not the practicedo ſo too. <q rend="inline">'But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives us another remedy in this caſe; that if the Monarchs Act of Exorbitancy or Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be mortal, and ſuch as ſuffered, diſſolves the Frame of the Government and publick Liberty, then the illegality is to be laid open, and redreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſought by Petition. Which is true, for an Appeal to the Law from the violence of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Miniſters, is really a Petition for Juſtice to the King himſelf, who is by the Law ſuppoſed preſent in the perſons of his Judges that repreſent him: and this the Author himſelf in a better humour does confeſs in his <hi>Patriarcha</hi> P. 93. The people have the Law as a familiar interpreter of the Kings pleaſure, which being publiſhed throughout the Kingdom doth repreſent the preſence and Majeſty of the King; alſo the Judges and Magiſtrates are reſtrained by the common Rules of Law from uſing their own Liberty to the injury of others, ſince they are to judg according to the Laws, and not to follow their own Opinions. And becauſe it might ſo happen that the King may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50833:107"/> ſurpriſed or importuned to write Orders or Letters to the Judges to direct them to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law.</q> The King himſelf in Parliament hath declared, <note place="margin">

And therefore Sir <hi>John Markham,</hi> when Chief Juſtice told King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. <hi>That the King cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt any Man himſelf for ſuſpition of Treaſon or Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as other of his Lieges may: for if it be a wrong to the party grieved, he has no remedy. Therefore if any Act or thing be done to the Subject contrary to the Law, the Judges and Miniſters of Juſtice are to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and puniſhed if the Laws are violated, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection made upon the King, who is ſtill ſuppoſed to do his Subjects Right. Si factam fuerit injuſtum (ſays</hi> Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton <hi>per inde non fuerit factum Regis.</hi> And thus much will ſerve for a further Anſwer to the Authors Query before mentioned. Whether it be a ſin for a Subject to diſobey the King if he command any thing contrary to his Laws, ſince all the Subjects both great and ſmall are ſuppoſed to know what the Rights and Priviledges of the Subject are, as well as what are the Prerogatives of the Crown, nor are theſe reſerved Caſes ſo many or ſo difficult as the Anthor would make us believe; but that they may be eaſily underſtood without Appealing to any other Judg then the Conſcience of every honeſt man. And though the King may for our common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in time of War make Bulwarks upon another mans Land, or command a Houſe to be pull'd down if the next be on Fire: or the Suburbs of a City to be demoliſhed in time of War to make it ſerviceable; though men may juſtify their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuch Caſes, yet it were folly and madneſs from thence to argue, that the King were as much to be obeyed if he commanded us to pull down a

But it would be our Crime, and we alone were puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if we ſhould obey ſuch a Command, and it is only upon this ſuppoſition, whether the ſufficiency of the Protection of our Laws and the integrity of the Judges, declared in the 14th of his now Majeſties Reign, by the Act concerning the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, be full? that it is a Traiterous Poſition that Arms may be taken by his Majeſties Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Perſon, or againſt thoſe Commiſſioned by him, in perſuance of Military Commiſſions, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuppoſe the King will not make uſe of the Militia for the deſtruction but the preſervation of the Subjects juſt Rights, and becauſe all Officers of the Army or Militia, are at their Peril, to take notice whether their Orders are according to Law or not. For they put it thus, though to take free Quarter or to hang a man by Martial-Law in time of War be lawful, yet to do ſo in time of Peace, though in the Kings Name, is Robbery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

Much more in the caſe of a King, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the peoples concerns, with which he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, hath likewiſe his own Crown and Dignity at Stake. So likewiſe a King will eaſily pardon a Subject who upon a ſudden Inſurrection or Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, raiſes Forces and marches againſt the Enemy, without ſtaying for a Commiſſion; and when a Prince hath ſo well ſatisfied his Subjects that he never intends to make uſe of this Prerogative but for the good and preſervation of his people, he may do almoſt what he pleaſes, and no body will be concerned. And this made <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> meet with that great Affection and Confidence that ſhe did throughout her whole Reign; for though ſhe ſometimes exerciſed as high Acts of Prerogative as ſome of her Predeceſſors, yet ſhe had the good luck to have ſcarce any of them queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament: becauſe the whole Nation was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ſhe acted for the beſt, and ſought no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but the publick good and ſafety of the Kingdom.

               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> proceeds in the ſame Paragraph, and ſuppoſes that redreſsment by Petition failing (that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50833:109"/> is, that the Judges either do not, or will not act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Oathes) then (if the Exorbitancy <q rend="inline">'or tranſgreſſion be mortal to the Government) prevention by reſiſtance ought to be: and if it be apparent, and appeal be made to the Conſciences of Mankind, then the Fundamental Laws of that Monarchy muſt judg and pronounce ſentence in every mans Conſcience,</q> and every man (ſo far as concerns him) muſt follow the Evidence of Truth in his own Senſe, to oppoſe or not oppoſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he can in Conſcience acquit or Condemn the Act of the Governour or Monarch.</p>
               <p>This our Author finds fault with: <q rend="inline">'Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the laying open of illegal Commands, he will have Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s meaning to be, that each pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man in his peculiar caſe, ſhould make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Remonſtrance to the World, of the illegal Acts of the Monarch, and then if upon his Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he cannot be relieved according to his Deſire, he ought to make Reſiſtance. Whereupon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would know who can be Judg, whether the illegality be made ſufficiently apparent? It is a main point, ſince every man is prone to flatter himſelf in his own cauſe, and to think it good, and that the wrong or injuſtice he ſuffers is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, when moderate and indifferent men can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover no ſuch thing: and in this caſe the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the common people cannot be gathered or known by any poſſible means; or if it could, it were like to be various and erronious.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In which Annimadverſion of our Author, he firſt lays that to Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Charge, which he does no where affirm; that every particular Subject, when injured, ſhould make a publick remonſtrance to the people; but only lay it open to the Monarch, or his Judges that repreſent him, by Petition. And ſure there is a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50833:110"/> great deal of difference between a Petition, and a Remonſtrance. He does not ſay that every ſingle Subject failing of Redreſs by Petition, ought to make reſiſtance in his own caſe, for he before ſuppoſes the Exorbitant Act or Tranſgreſſion not to be Mortal, &amp; ſuch as ſuffered, diſſolves the Frame of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and publick Liberty. And that in ſuch lighter caſes for the publick Peace, we ought to ſubmit and make no reſiſtance at all, but <hi>de jure cedere;</hi> which can never fall out, as long as this Tranſgreſſion or Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitance extends it ſelf only to ſome particular men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Author will have no particular man to be Judg in his own Cauſe. I grant it, if by <hi>Judg</hi> he means <hi>Execution</hi> too, by publick reſiſtance. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a mans paſſing his judgment or declaring it, that he thinks himſelf injured, ſuppoſe by a Decree in <hi>Chancery</hi> or Act of Parliament, does not diſturb the Goverment or publick Peace. But he may if he pleaſe bring his Appeal, or a new Bill in Parliament and have the unjuſt Decree or Act reverſed, which he can never do, if he did believe he ought not to make the injuſtice or illegality of this Act or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree apparent to thoſe that are to give him redreſs, but if this Exorbitant Act or Tranſgreſſion be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and preſſes upon all alike, I deny that the Judgment of the common people cannot be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or known by any poſſible means: or if it could it were like to be various and erroneous. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the illegal Act were ſo publickly declared that for the future all Taxes ſhould be raiſed without conſent of Parliament: or that all menſhould be tried for their Lives without Juries. I would fain know whether the Judgment not only of the Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but of all the people, may not be eaſily known, though not gathered by Vote? or whether it would be various and erroneous in theſe caſes. Fr the people
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50833:110"/> though they do not argue ſo ſubtilly as our Author does, yet in their Sence of Feeling, when wrong'd or hurt, are ſeldome miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Then our Author is angry that Mr. <hi>H. will have an Appeal made to the Conſciences of all Mankind, that being made, that the Fundamental Laws muſt judg and pronounce Sentence in every mans own Conſcience, here he would fain learn of Mr. H. or any other for him, what a Fundamental Law is, or elſe have but one Law named to him, that any Man ſhall ſay is a Fundamental Law of the Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, to do the Authors Friends a pleaſure, (ſince he is dead himſelf) I will name one that he himſelf would deny to be one in this Monarchy; and that is, that the Crown upon the death of the King ſhould deſcend to the next Heir, and ſo we have one Fundamental Law, and I hope there may be more. But he ſays Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tells us, <q rend="inline">'that the Common Laws are the Foundation, and the Statute Laws ſuperſtructive.</q> Yet our Author thinks that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> dares ſay, <q rend="inline">'that there is any one branch or part of the Common Law, but may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Act of Parliament; for many points of the Common-Law <hi>(de facto)</hi> have, and <hi>(de jure)</hi> any point may be taken away. How can that be called a Fundamental, which hath and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and yet the Statute Laws ſtand firm and Stable! It is contrary to the Nature of a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, for the Building to ſtand, when the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is taken away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All which, is mere wrangling about the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of a Foundation and a Superſtructure, as if ſuch expreſſions required an abſolute Phyſical Truth as they do in the things from which they are taken.</p>
               <p>It is already granted, that all Laws in a limited Government, but thoſe of Nature, and right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50833:111"/> are alterable, becauſe the Governmen it ſelf is ſo, and in reſpect of which alone they may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fundamental, or Foundations of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but theſe being altered, it would ceaſe to be the ſame kind of Government it was before.</p>
               <p>I will not affirm, but the people of this Nation may give away their preſent Rights of not having any Laws made, or Taxes impoſed upon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent, or of not being perpetually kept in Priſon or put to death without legal Trial.</p>
               <p>But theſe being altered, it would ceaſe to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and turn to an abſolute Monarchy, and all Statutes concerning any of theſe would be ſo far Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructives, as to ſignify nothing when the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are taken away, and indeed how any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law made by Parliament could ſignify any thing when the Parliament is gone, I know not, ſince all Laws after that would depend upon the ſole will of the Monarch.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Reaſon is, <q rend="inline">'That the Common-Law is generally acknowledged to be nothing elſe but common Uſage or Cuſtome, which by length of time only obtains Authority: ſo that it follows in time after Government, but cannot go before it, or be the Rule of Government by any Original Radical Conſtitution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which is not true, as the Author hath laid it down; for all the parts of the Common-Law do not depend upon meer Cuſtome or Uſage taken up after the Government inſtituted: and therefore his conſequence that follows from this is falſe. For ſome parts of the Common-Law of <hi>England,</hi> are without doubt as antient as the Goverment it ſelf. Thus, though ſome parts of our Common-Law may have proceeded from ſome later Cuſtomes, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Judgments and reſolutions of the Judges in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50833:111"/> ſeveral Ages, yet without doubt, Property in Goods and Land and Eſtates of Inheritance, and the manner of their deſcent are as antient (ſince they came over with our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors) as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it ſelf, ſince ſome of the Laws. As, that Brethren by the half-Blood, ſhould not be Heirs to each other. That an Eſtate ſhould rather Eſcheat then aſcend to the Father, upon the death of his, could only proceed from the Cuſtome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Saxons.</hi> For certainly, had we not been uſed to them, we ſhould ſcarce allow them to be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. But it is in nothing more viſible then in thoſe Tenures (which the modern <hi>Civilians</hi> call <hi>Feudat</hi>) which <hi>L.

               </p>
               <p>In which paſſage the Author hath diſcovered, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great deal of Ignorance, or inadvertency in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50833:112"/> the Hiſtory and Government of his Country. For firſt he Confeſſes that the Engliſh <hi>Saxons</hi> had a Meeting, which they called the Aſſembly of the Wife, termed in <hi>Latine, Conventus Magnatum,</hi> or <hi>Praeſentia Regis, Procerumque Prelatorum Collecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or in general, <hi>Magnum,</hi> or <hi>Commune concilium,</hi> &amp;c. All which Meetings may in a general ſence be termed Parliaments: yet he will not allow, there could be any Parliaments aſſembled of the general Eſtates of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the reaſon he gives us before. What he means by, <hi>until about the time of the Conqueſt,</hi> I know not; but this is certain, that from the time of King <hi>Egbert,</hi> who is reckoned the firſt Monarch, the great Council, or <hi>Wittena Gemore</hi> conſiſted of the General Eſtates of the <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi>-Kindom, and if the whole people of <hi>England</hi> had not their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives there, it was becauſe they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by their Tributary Princes or Kings, who Governed Subordinately to this Monarch, until the coming of the <hi>Danes.</hi> Thus the Weſt-angles had their particular Kings in the time of King <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> St. <hi>Edmund</hi> the laſt King being Conquered by the <hi>Danes.</hi> So likewiſe had the <hi>Mercians</hi> their King <hi>Beorced;</hi> their laſt King being driven out by the ſame Invaders about the ſame time, and after the Kingdom was at Peace again, and the <hi>Danes</hi> in great part ſubdued or quiet, King <hi>Alfred</hi> Re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the Mercian-Kingdom, gave it in Marriage to a <hi>Saxon</hi> Nobleman called <hi>Etheldred,</hi> who had Married his Daughter <hi>Elſteda,</hi> who was long after her Husbands Death Lady, or Queen of the <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50833:114"/> againſt us, as long as we can prove that in the main, the Government of them all was alike in the three great Liberties of the Subjects, <hi>viz.</hi> Trial by a Mans equals, and abſolute Propriety in Lands, and Goods which the Kings could not juſtly take from them; and a Right to joyne in the making of all Laws, and raiſing Publick Taxes, or Contributions for War. So that without doubt theſe <hi>Wittena Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes,</hi> or great Councils were Ordained for ſome Nobler and Higher purpoſe, then either to give the King advice, what Wars to make, or what Laws to make, or barely to Remonſtrate their grievances (as this and ſome other Modern Authors would have it) for what King would call ſo great a Multitude thoſe Antient Parliaments conſiſted of) to be his Councellors: Or would call together the whole Body of a Nation, only to be made acquainted with their grievances, which he might have known with greater eaſe to himſelf, and leſs charge to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; by having them found by the Grand Inqueſt in the County-Court: And ſo to have been preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by the Earl, or Alderman of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar County; whereas we find theſe great Councils imploy'd in buſineſſes of a higher Nature; ſuch as the confirmation of the Kings Charters, the Propoſing of Laws, the Election of Archbiſhops, &amp; other great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: So that the Higher any Man will look back, the more large, &amp; uncontroulable he will find the Power of this great Aſſembly: Since before the Conqueſt, and afterwards too, we find them to have often Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kings, when the Children of their laſt King were either Minors, or ſuppoſed unfit to Govern.

This is almoſt the ſame Argument as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make uſe of againſt the Scriptures being a Rule of Faith, only their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is that the Scriptures are obſcure, becauſe they are Written and need an Expoſitor, <hi>viz.</hi> The Church, or Tradition; but with Authors it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Law is doubtful, becauſe unwritten, whereas all that underſtand any thing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> know very well that the Common Law, whoſe Authority depends not on any ſet Form of Words, but the Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50833:115"/> of the Law is much leſs doubtful, and makes fewer Diſputes then the Statute-Law; but though it be granted that many things in the Common Law, are doubtful and difficult; yet in the Main and Fundamental parts of it, but juſt now recited, it is plain enough: (As the Scriptures though doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or obſcure in ſome things; yet are plain and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in all Points neceſſary for Salvation; and why it is harder for an ordinary Countrey Fellow in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, to know when he is Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be Hang'd without trial or to have his Goods, or Money taken from him, by a Fellow in a Red-coat without any Law, then for him to judg in the State of Nature, when another Man lies with his Wife, or goes about to Rob or Murther him I know not. His laſt Reaſon againſt making Common Law, only to be the Foundation, when <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is excluded from being (according to Mr. <hi>H.</hi>) a Fundamental Law, and alſo all <q rend="inline">'other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, from being limitations to Monarchy, ſince the Fundamental Laws only are to be judg; and theſe are Statute Laws or Superſtructures.</q> This is alſo meer Sophiſtry, ſince no Man in Metaphors or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes ever expects an abſolute Truth; but what if the great part of the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> were Fundamental Laws before either King <hi>Stephen,</hi> or King <hi>John</hi> granted it, and that they did but reſtore what ſome of their Predeceſſors had before by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion taken from their Subjects; ſince there is little or none of it, but was part of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, and conſequently the Ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Law before the Conqueſt; and the like may be ſaid of all other Conſtitutions in limited Monarchies; as ſuppoſe, in <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Crown which was before Elective, is now by the Conceſſion of the Eſtates, become Succeſſive; I believe no Men of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50833:116"/> Opinion will deny, that this is not now a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law in that Kindom, and can never be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the Conſent of the King and the Eſtates, and yet this is a Law that follows after the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Inſtituted; nor can I ſee any Reaſon, why this Rule may not hold as well on the Peoples ſide, as the Kings. Why Rules of Play may not be made as well after the Gameſters are in at Play, as when they firſt began; and may not be as well called Fundamental Laws of the Game; ſince if they are not obſerved, it may be lawful for any of the Gameſters to fling up his Cards, and play no more, though he be at play with (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Natural Monarch) his own Father.</p>
               <p>But our Author will not leave off ſo, but muſt give us one ſtabing Paragraph more againſt Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws, which is thus, <q rend="inline">'<hi>Truely the Conſcience of all Mankind is a pretty large Tribunal,</hi> for theſe Fundamental Laws to pronounce Sentence in. It is very much that Laws which in their own Nature are dumb and always need a Judg to pronounce Sentence, ſhould now be able to ſpeak, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Sentence themſelves: Such a Sentence ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be upon the hearing of one Party only; for it is impoſſible for a Monarch to make his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Anſwer, and produce his Witneſſes: in every Mans Conſcience in each Mans Cauſe; who will but queſtion the Legality of the Monarchs Government. Certainly the Sentence cannot but be unjuſt, where but one Mans Tale is heard.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Sentence of this Paragraph is Anſwered ſufficiently in the Obſervation upon the laſt Reaſon; but one. As for Written Laws, every Body knows they are adumb Letter; as they lie in Ink &amp; Paper, but as they come to be from thence Copied out and fixed in Mens Memories they are not dumb, neither always needs
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50833:116"/> a Judg to pronounce Sentence, but are able enough to ſpeak oftentimes againſt the Sentence of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judg, and all the Standers by can eaſily tell if a Judg ſhould go about to Trie and Condemn a Man without ever Impanelling a Jury, nor needs there any Defence for the Judg in this caſe; but that a Man may ſafely give his Sentence in this Caſe without hearing the Judges Reaſon; ſince it is plain there can be none given. But as for the Monarch, it is ſuppoſed that he hath already made his Defence by his Atturney, and produced his Witneſſes when the Subject Petitioned his Judges to right him in what he conceived to be an Oppreſſion. So that the <hi>Sentence cannot be unjuſt, where but one Mans Tale is heard.</hi> But if the Judges in this Caſe (as in that of Ship-Money) cannot convince the Plantiff, but that he is oppreſſed contrary to Law. It is neither his nor their Judgment that can alter the Caſe: But if he can have no other remedy, he muſt even go home and expect better opportunities of being righted, as when there are honeſter Judges; or the calling of a Parliament, one of whoſe ends is to redreſs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of that kind by repreſenting to the King the faults and tranſgreſſions of his Miniſters, who only are puniſhable, and anſwerable for the injuſtice; ſince the King in his own Perſon can do none (as I have often affirmed) as for Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s concluſion, that every man muſt oppoſe or not oppoſe the Monarch, acoording to his own Conſcience, when he can have no other redreſs, I do not approve of it. For I will not ſuppoſe any time (in which this Nation is not oppreſed by a ſtanding Army, or Men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Principles in Religion and Goverment;) but the Subject may find redreſs, if not at one time, yet at another. But the other part of the diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Author and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> whether this Power
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50833:117"/> of every Mans judging of the illegal Acts of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <q rend="inline">'argues not a Superiority of thoſe who Judg, over him who is Judged,</q> becauſe it is not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and Civil, but Moral reſiding in Reaſonable Creatures, and lawful for them to execute, which is not ſo hard to underſtand as the Author makes it, if we take this Word <hi>Moral</hi> (as it is plain Mr. <hi>H.</hi> uſes it) in contradiction to Civil Power, which is ſuch a right of acting as every private Man hath, though he hath no Civil Authority. For a Mans bare judging of the juſtice and injuſtice of all Actions that concern him, or any other man, are inſeparable from the Nature of Man? whether they are ordered by a Prince, or private Man; and a Princes commanding this or that to be done, or giving his judgment this way, or that way, cannot alter theſe ſettled Rules whereby Men judg of right and wrong. So that if this Author or his Friends will make uſe of Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Arguments of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Judgment of one Man in all Points what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they muſt likewiſe take what follows, that there is likewiſe no good, or evil, or right, or wrong in the ſtate of Nature, but what the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch judges to be ſo; and when that is done, if the Authors Friends have any Religion, let them ſee what they will get by it; but the Author ſuppoſes he hath ſufficient advantage over Mr: <hi>H.</hi> becauſe he hath laid it down in the Page before going; <q rend="inline">'That reſiſtance ought to be made, and every Man muſt oppoſe, or not oppoſe, according as in Conſcience he can acquit, or condemn the Acts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. For (ſays the Author) if it enable a Man to reſiſt, and oppoſe his <hi>Governor without Queſtion</hi> 'tis Authoritative, and Civil.</q> As for Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Aſſertion) I will not take upon me to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in ſo nice a Point, though he hath in all his

As to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> I ſhall only add, that the Defence which the Nobility and People made of their Antient Rights was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or declared Rebellion, either by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or any other Statute; but on the contrary, the breakers thereof were declared <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the ſolemn form of which (and where the King himſelf who had ſo often broke his Oath bore a part) ſee in <hi>Mat. Paris.</hi> Anno 125. But to return to our Author (from whom I have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle degreſſed) I think he is miſtaken in affirming all Power which enables in ſome caſes a Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or oppoſe his Governors, muſt be Authoritative and Civil: Therefore I ſhall put the ſame caſe again which I did about the beginning of theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the Natural Power of Fathers: Suppoſe a Son cannot otherwiſe preſerve his own Life, or that of his Mother, or Brothers from the rage of his mad or drunken Father; but by holding him, or binding him, if need be; I ſuppoſe no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man will deny the lawfullneſs of this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet this Power over his Fathers Perſon is not Authoritative, or Civil, but Moral, and which the Son does exerciſe not as Superior to his Father, but as a Rational Creature obliged by the Laws of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50833:118"/> Nature, to preſerve his own being, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the good preſervation of his Parents and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not againſt Paternal Authority (which is always Rational, and for the good of the Family) but Brutiſh, Irrational force: Which God gives every Man a right to judg of; ſo likewiſe if a Prince prove either a Madman, or a ſtark Fool, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which their Subjects exerciſe in the ordering him, or confining him, and appointing Regents, or Protectors to Govern for him, and in his Name, is not Authoritative, or Civil, ſince the Prince himſelf who is the Fountain of all Authority, gave them no ſuch power, and therefore muſt be Natural, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or reſiding in them as reaſonable Creatures. And of this we have had divers examples. Thus the <hi>French</hi> were forced to confine their Mad King <hi>Charles</hi> VI. and appoint his Queen to be Regent during his Diſtraction. So likewiſe <hi>Joan</hi> Queen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> falling Diſtracted upon the Death of Her Husband King <hi>Philip</hi> I. Her Father <hi>Ferdinand</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in Her right; and after His deceaſe, Her Son <hi>Charles</hi> afterwards Emperor (ſhe continuing bereft of her underſtanding) was admitted King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile.</hi> And what hath been done lately in <hi>Portugal,</hi> is ſo notorious, that it needs not a particular Recital. So then Mr. <hi>Hs.</hi> expreſſion, That this is a Moral Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſiding in reaſonable Creatures, and lawful for them to execute, may not ſeem ſo abſurd as to imply what our Author endeavours to draw from <hi>thence, that Authoritative,</hi> and Civil <hi>Judgment does not</hi> reſide in <hi>reaſonable Creatures,</hi> nor can <hi>be Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> executed: ſince a Reaſonable Creature may be endued with another Power of acting precedent to that of the Civil.</p>
               <p>So I ſhall likewiſe leave it to the Judgment of the impartial Reader, whether this concluſion fits
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50833:119"/> ſo well with Anarchy as the Author will have it. As alſo whether Mr. <hi>H.</hi> take away all Government by leaving every Man to his own Conſcience to judg when the Prince oppreſſes him; for elſe how could he ſue for relief to the Prince himſelf; and ſo all actions a Prince did, or commanded would be juſt, and lawful though never ſo contrary to Reaſon, or poſitive Law. And ſo there would be truly (as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> aſſerts) no other meaſure of good, and evil, right or wrong but the Princes will.</p>
               <p>But as I have no where maintained with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his Treatiſe, which our Author writes againſt, that ours is a mixt Monarchy though limited by Law; and therefore ſhall not maintain as he does the King to be one of the Three Eſtates (according to the Opinions held during the late Wars. So on the other ſide, that there is, and ever hath been ſuch a Government as a mixt Monarchy in ſome Countreys, I hope I have made out (notwithſtanding what this Author ſays to the contrary: and that theſe might more properly be called a mixt Monarchy, then mixt Ariſtocracy, or mixt Democracy. Since all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this kind, take their denomination from the moſt Honourable and Predominant part in it, in whom the Executive or Authoritative part reſides.</p>
               <p>And though perhaps ſome of theſe Governments may not ſeem ſo firm, ſo regular, and well conſtituted as others, it does not therefore follow that they are meer Anarchies, or that all mixtures, and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Monarchy are vain, or unlawful as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor imagines.</p>
               <p>For a further proof of which, I will not give you may own ſence alone, but likewiſe of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Civil Lawyer Mr. <hi>Pufendorf</hi> now or very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gretian Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>

               <p>So much of Irregular Governments or Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies. But in the next Chapter of the ſame Book, the ſame Author ſpeaking of the rights of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power; where when he hath firſt proved, what it is that makes any Power be called Supreme in a Common-wealth, and that he who hath this Power muſt be free from puniſhment, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to humane Laws; and that he hath confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Long Parliaments diſtinction of a real and Perſonal Majeſty, and that Kings properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led muſt be Superior to all the People; and having anſwered the Objections to the contrary, at laſt he proceeds § 7 to ſhew what abſolute Power is, and that it is not found alike in all Forms of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and gives us the true Original of limited Governments; his ſence is ſo good, that I ſhall not much contract what he ſays, but give it you as it is, § 7. 8, 9, 10. Beſides it is apparent enough, that in ſome Common-wealths the Royal Authority is free in the exerciſe of its Acts, but reſtrained to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mode of acting, from whence aroſe the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Empire into limited, and abſolute, where in the firſt place it is to be explained, what is meant by the word abſolute, which is ſo odious to thoſe who have had their Education in free Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. Indeed the ſame word being ill interpreted, may incite ſome Princes to vex their Subjects, and to commit a great deal of wickedneſs. Flatterers adding fuel to the Fire, who are ſtill ready to encourage the Ambition, and other Vices of their Prince at this rate. Sir, you are abſolute, therefore if it pleaſes you, it is lawful: therefore you may tire out your own Subjects, and all your Neighbours with unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Wars, that you may appear a mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and ſet forth your own Glory; therefore you may affront, and inſult over whom you pleaſe, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50833:121"/> drain your Subjects with all ſorts of Exactions, that you may have wherewith to ſerve your Luxury, or Ambition; according to the Flattery of <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> upon the death of <hi>Clitus,</hi> that right and wrong, <note place="margin">Plutarch. <hi>ad Princi. indoct.</hi>
                  </note> do ſit by <hi>Jupiter;</hi> that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the King does, ought to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right, and juſt ſo that there are ſome who go about to eſtabliſh the abſolute right of Kings by Arguments, that ſeem to have no other Meaſure thereof, then impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and a Licenſe to vex their People. Therefore as by an abſolute Liberty of particular Men is meant, their judging of their own affairs and actions, according to their own, and not anothers judgment: yet ſtill ſuppoſing their Obligation to the Laws of Nature, And that this Liberty belongs to all Men, who are not as yet ſubject to anothers will: ſo where divers Men have United together into a perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it is neceſſary for the ſame liberty or facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of appointing, reſolving all means neceſſary for their own ſafety, ſhould now exiſt in the Supreme Power, as in a common Subject: which Liberty is accompanied with the Higheſt Authority, or a right of preſcribing thoſe means to the Subjects, and of compelling them to their Duty; therefore in every Commonwealth properly ſo called, there muſt be an abſolute Power at leaſt habitual, though not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, for it muſt be anſwerable to Superior, and to have a right of Judging of its own affairs by its own Judgment and will. Therefore that abſolute Power implies nothing in its ſelf unjuſt, or intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is eaſie to be perceived from the ends of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of Commonwealths. For indeed we never conſtituted them, that neglecting Natural right, things ſhould be done out of a wicked, and perverſe Luſt or Humour; but that the ſecurity and ſafety of ſingulars may be more conveniently looked after by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50833:121"/> the joint aſſiſtances of many. So that they might more ſafely and with more leaſure live after the Laws of Nature, and Virtue.</p>
               <p>Yet when this Supreme Authority is conſidered as it is conferred upon one Man, or one Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of all, or few, as in its proper ſubject, it is not always free, and abſolute, but in ſome places limited by certain laws; indeed in <hi>Democracies</hi> the difference between abſolute, and limited Power ſeems not ſo eaſie to be obſerved, for although in every Democracy there muſt needs continue certain Inſtitutions received by uſe, or eſtabliſht by written Laws, at what time, and by whom the People ſhould be Aſſembled, and Publick buſineſs propoſed, and Executed, ſince without ſuch things, a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth cannot be underſtood, yet ſince that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil conſiſts of all the Citizens, in whom the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority reſides; nothing can hinder, but thoſe Conſtitutions may be altered or abrogated at any time by the ſame People that made them.</p>
               <p>But in Ariſtocracies and Monarchies, where there are ſome who command, and others who obey, and ſo a Right ariſes to theſe from the Promiſes and Commands of the other. There does plainly appear a difference between an abſolute and limited power, he is therefore abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute who exerciſes his Authority according to his own diſcretion, and not according to the Rule of any certain, or perpetual Conſtitutions; but as the preſent condition of affairs require, and who does ſo provide for the ſafety of the Common-wealth, as its occaſions direct him: from whence the word ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute is ſo far from implying any thing unjuſt or hateful in it ſelf, or intolerable for Free-men; that it ſhould rather lay upon ſuch abſolute Princes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of greater care and circumſpection, if they
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50833:122"/> will acquit themſelves of their Duty, and diſcharge their Conſciences as they ought; then on thoſe to whom a certain form of diſpatching publick Affairs is preſcribed. So <hi>Dio Chryſoſt. Orati.</hi> 62. deſcribes an abſolute Prince thus, <q rend="inline">"a good Prince covets nothing becauſe he ſuppoſes himſelf to poſſeſs all things, he abſtains from pleaſures, ſince he may enjoy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſes. He is juſter than others, as he who is to be an example of Juſtice to others. He takes pleaſure in buſineſs, becauſe he labours of his own accord. He loves the Laws, becauſe he does not fear them; and of all theſe he rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades himſelf: for who hath greater need of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then he who deliberates of ſuch great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? Who of more exact Juſtice, then he who is above the Laws? Who of a more ſevere modeſty, than he to whom all things are Lawful? Who of greater Fortitude, than he who keeps all things in ſafety?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet becauſe the Judgment of any one man in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning that which truly conduces to the publick ſafety may be eaſily deceived, neither is there in all Men that ſtrength of mind, that they may know how in ſo great a Liberty to govern their Paſſions and Luſts (as <hi>Herodian Li.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. well obſerves) that it is difficult in the higheſt Liberty for a Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain himſelf, &amp; as it were to bridle his own deſires. Therefore it ſeemed moſt convenient to divers peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not to commit ſo great a power to one mans ſole diſcretion, and he no more free from Errors than others, but rather more ſubject to Vices; and therefore would rather preſcribe the Prince a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Form or Method of diſpatching of publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, after it was at firſt found out what ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, or forms of diſpatching publick Affairs did beſt ſuit with the Genius of the people, and the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50833:122"/> Nature of the Common-wealth to be conſtituted. Neither is there any injury done to the Prince, who was at firſt raiſed to that Dignity by the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people upon thoſe conditions. For if it ſeemed grievous to take the ſupreme Authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not manage it as he pleaſed, he might have refuſed it if he would; ſo the Conſcience of the Oath by which they are obliged upon their taking this Authority ought to reſtrain them and their Succeſſors from going about to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abſolute by ſecret Machinations and Deſigns: Much leſs to ſubvert the Laws of the Kingdom by force. <note place="margin">Plin. Paneg.</note> 
                  <hi>Since an Oath is not more Religiouſly to be obſerved by any than he whom it moſt chiefly concerns not to be perjured.</hi> For that is too weak which ſome maintain, that ſince Kings are ordained by God, who injoyns them a true diſcharge of their Duty, which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the exerciſe of the moſt abſolute power: and therefore God is to be ſuppoſed to have conferred ſuch a proportion of power on all Kings, as that they ought not to ſuffer the leaſt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be diminiſhed or circumſcribed, and that the People can neither rightly require or oblige their King to it; no more than there can honeſtly be made ſuch a bargain between a Husband and a Wife that he ſhould connive at her ſtolen pleaſures. But as we have already ſufficiently proved, that as all Civil Government is from God, yet is ſo left in Mans diſpoſal (at leaſt to thoſe that God did not give any particular Laws to) what ſort of Government they would ſet up (as <hi>Phil. Melancthon</hi> in his <hi>Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Moral Philoſophy,</hi> honeſtly teaches, <hi>That the forms of Kingdoms are different, and in ſome places there are ſome degrees of Liberty more than in others: For God approves all Forms of Government that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50833:123"/> to Right, Nature, and Reaſon;</hi> and as I think there is no where any Divine precept extant, that a free People being about to chuſe it ſelf a King, ſhould chuſe <hi>Cajus</hi> rather than <hi>Titius,</hi> no more is there any certain form Divinely eſtabliſh'd, under which, and no other Authority, is to be conferred on Princes. Neither are theſe Men any way helped by that place of 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. where ſome will have only the bare unjuſt practice of Kings, that the true right of all Kings is to be there deſcribed. But <hi>Grotius,</hi> Lib 1. c. 4. § 3. Taking a middle way lays down, that there the bare actions of a King is deſcribed, yet what hath the effect of a right, to wit an Obligation of <hi>non</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: So that however a King may act againſt his Duty when he commits ſuch things; yet that his Subject ſought no more to reſiſt, than if he had acted thus by the higheſt Right; and therefore it is added that the People preſſed by thoſe vexations ſhould cry to God, becauſe there remained no humane reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. So that this was called the Right of the King in that ſence as the <hi>Roman</hi> Praetor was ſayed, <hi>jus red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> to judg right, even then when he decreed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly; however I conceive the true ſence of this place may be thus underſtood, there had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto a Democracy among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but that which often reſembled that ſort of Kingdome which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls Heroical. The Judges incited by a divine inſtinct did for the moſt part reſcue the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed People from their Enemies, or elſe in Peace Judged Cauſes: but in other matters were rather endued with a power of perſwading, than command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but yet their Equipage and State being ſmall, was not born or encreaſed by any Publick Taxes; yet the People weary of this Government, would have a King after the manner of other Nations: That is, who ſhould appear in great State, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50833:123"/> Splendour, and ſhould maintain a conſtant Guard, or at leaſt ſhould ſtill exerciſe his Subjects in Arms, that they might ſtill be able to meet their Enemies in the Field, ſee <hi>Sam.</hi> XIII. 2. XIV. 48, 52. Now <hi>Samuel,</hi> that the People might conſider of it ſoberly before hand, lays open to them the Prerogatives of ſuch a King: and the inconveniencies of that Government. You would have a King remarkable by a great deal of Splendour; but ſuch a one muſt be attended with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Train, and ſo will take your Sons, and appoint them for himſelf, and to be his Horſemen, and to run before his Chariots. You would have a King. who ſhould maintain an Army; but it <hi>will be neceſſary that he appoint him Captains over Hundreds, and Captains over Fifties;</hi> and this muſt be of your Sons, who were uſed before to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your own buſineſs only; the greatneſs of his affairs, and the ſtate of his Office, will not permit this King to till his own Land; Therefore of your Sons will he ſet ſome to Ear his Ground, and Reap his Harveſt, and to make his Inſtruments of War; and ſince beſides he muſt need a great deal of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and that it will not become the Dignity of his Wives, or Daughters, to look after the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-affairs. Therefore he will take your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be Confectioners, to be Cooks, and to be Bakers; he will likewiſe ſtand in need of many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to diſpatch the buſineſſes of War and Peace, and who all muſt have Salaries: and therefore he will take your Fields, and your Vineyards and your Olive-Yards, and give them to your Servants: and to this purpoſe he will take the Tenth of your Seed, and of your Vineyards, and give to his Officers, and to his Servants, and he will likewiſe when he hath need, take your Men-ſervants, and your Maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and your young Men, and your Aſſes, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50833:124"/> put them to his work. In ſhort he ſays no more than this; If you will have a King, he muſt be maintained like a King, and a certain Revenue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this end; of which burthen if you are afterwards a weary, you ſhall not be able to Depoſe him again, ſince he obtain'd the Kingdom by your choice and conſent, and ſo cannot be taken from him. So that it is plain, that this place does not at all ſerve to Patronize evil Princes; ſo neither that there is here any limited Power conferred by God after the manner of a conſtant and unalterable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and of which no conſtitutions can diminiſh any part; ſince here only the neceſſary Charges and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as well of an abſolute, as of a limited Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are deſcribed; therefore it is wholly in the will of a free People, whether they will have an abſolute Power, or will deliver it with certain Laws, ſo that thoſe Laws contain nothing that is wicked, or which may deſtroy the ends of Government; for although Men at the beginning did freely enter into a civil Society, yet ſince they were before obliged to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Law of Nature, they ought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſuch Rules of Power, and civil Obedience which might be agreeable to that Law, and to the lawful ends of all Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>But as it may rightly be underſtood, by what ſort of Promiſe, a Kingly Government may ceaſe to be abſolute (for every promiſe hath not that force) it is to be underſtood that a King upon his taking the Kingdom, may oblige himſelf either by a General, or ſpecial Promiſe, which for the moſt part is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Religion of an Oath. A General Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may be made either tacitely or expreſly. A tacite Promiſe of Governing well is underſtood in the very acceptance of the Kingdom, although there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing expreſly Promiſed; yet moſt commonly this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50833:124"/> ought to be made expreſly not without an Oath, &amp; the ſolemnity of certain rights; neither is it unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that in this promiſe the Office of a King ſhould be deſcribed by a Periphraſis, or enumeration of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts; as ſuppoſe it be, that he will take care of the Publick ſafety; that he will defend the good, and puniſh the bad, that he will Adminiſter indifferent Juſtice, that he will oppreſs no Body, or the like. Such Promiſſes do not all detract from abſoluteneſs of his Power. ſince the King is indeed obliged by thoſe general Promiſes, to govern well; but what Method, or what means he ſhall make uſe of for this end is left to his will, and diſcretion; but a ſpecial promiſe, and in which both the Method, and means to be uſed in the Adminiſtring the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are particularly expreſſed, ſeem to have a twofold Power; for one only obliges the Conſcience of the King; but the other makes the Obedience of the Subjects depend upon its performance, as upon an expreſs condition. <hi>A</hi> Promiſe of the firſt ſort is thus, If the King ſhould ſwear, for example, that he will not beſtow any Offices of truſt, on ſuch a ſort of Men, that he will not grant any Priviledges to any which ſhall redound to the prejudice of others, that he will make no new Laws, or impoſe new Taxes or Cuſtoms, or will not uſe Foreign Souldiers or the like. Yet if there be no certain Council, or Aſſembly Couſtituted, which the King ſhould be obliged to conſult, whether the occaſions of the Common-wealth require he ſhould depart from thoſe Engagements (for there is ſtill in all of them, that tacite exception ſtill underſtood (unleſs the Safety of the Common-wealth the Supreme Law in all ſuch Engagements require otherwiſe) and which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil by its own right, and not precariouſly can take cognizance of thoſe affairs, and without whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50833:125"/> the Subjects cannot be obliged to obſerve the Kings commands in ſuch matters; here the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the ſupreme Authority being reſtrained to certain Laws, if the King ſhall act otherwiſe (unleſs in caſes of great neceſſity,) he is without doubt guilty of the breach of his Oath; yet there does not therefore belong any power to the Subject to deny Obedience to the Kings commands, or of making thoſe actions void. For if the King do ſay, That the ſafety of the People, or ſome remarkable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Commonwealth requires him to break his Promiſe, as that preſumption always ought to go along with the Kings actions, the Subjects in this caſe have not any thing to reply: becauſe they have no faculty of taking Cognizance of thoſe actions, whether the neceſſity of the Common-wealth requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them or not; from which this is apparent, that they do not take a ſufficient caution, if they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their King but a limited Power, and yet hath not Conſtituted ſome great Council, without whoſe conſent thoſe actions excepted cannot be exerciſed, or unleſs there lie upon the King a neceſſity of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Eſtates, whenever he deliberates upon the exerciſe of thoſe Legiſlative Powers, for that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than if it ſhould be neceſſary for the King to conſult ſome Council, conſiſting only of ſome few of his Subjects: ſince it may eaſily happen that the private advantages of thoſe few may differ from the publick good, and likewiſe, they for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt, may not agree in thoſe things which are truly beneficial for their Prince.</p>
               <p>But the Authority of a King is more cloſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, if it be expreſly agreed between the King and People upon the conferring the ſupreme power upon Him, or his Anceſtors that he ſhould Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it according to certain Fundamental Laws;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50833:125"/> and concerning thoſe matters which he hath not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power to diſpoſe of, that he leave them to a great Council of the People, or Nobility, neither may decree any thing in thoſe matters without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and if they ſhould be done otherwiſe, that the Subjects would not be obliged to obſerve his commands in ſuch things; neither, yet is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power rendred defective by ſuch Fundamental Conſtitutions. For all the acts of Supreme Power may be exerciſed in ſuch a Kingdom, as well as in an abſolute one, unleſs that in the one, the King uſes his own Judgment alone, as deciſive, but in the other there is as it were a concomitant Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance remaining in the great Council, upon which power of the Supreme Authority it does not radically; but as it were conditionally depend, <hi>&amp; ſine qua non;</hi> neither are there in ſuch a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth two diſtinct wills, forall things which the Common-wealth wills, it wills them by the Kings will alone; although it might happen form that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, that certain conditions not being obſerved, the King cannot legally will ſome things, and ſo wills them in vain; but neither does the King ceaſe to have the ſupreme Power in ſuch a Kingdom; or that this Council is therefore above the King. For theſe are no true conſequences, that becauſe this Perſon cannot do all things according to his own humour, therefore he hath not ſupreme Power. I am not obliged to obey this Man in all things, therefore I am his Superior, or Equal: and theſe are likewiſe very different; I am bound to perform what this Man pleaſes; becauſe I have obliged my ſelf to it by compact; and I am obliged to follow this Mans will, becauſe he can enjoyn me thus by his ſupreme Authority. But ſupreme, and abſolute are not one, and the ſame thing, for that denotes the abſenſe of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50833:126"/> a Superiour, or an Equal in the ſame order or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but this a faculty of exerciſeing any right by a Mans own Judgment and Will; but what if there be added a Commiſſary clauſe; that if he ſhall do otherwiſe he ſhall forfeit his Kingdom; as the <hi>Arogonians</hi> of Old after the King had ſworn to their Priviledges, did promiſe him Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this manner: <note place="margin">

C.</hi> 12.</note> We, who are of as great Power as thou, do Create thee our King and Lord on this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that thou obſerve our Laws and Priviledges, if otherwiſe, not.</p>
               <p>Here it is certain, that an abſolute King cannot be He to whom the Kingdom is thus committed under a Commiſſary Clauſe, or Condition: but that this King may have for all this a regal Power though li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, I ſee no reaſon to the contrary; for although we grant a Temporary Authority cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for Supreme, becauſe it depends upon a poteſtative condition, and which can never be in the Princes power. Yet a King of this ſort above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd is not therefore ſubject to the power of the People, with whom the cognizance is whether he keep his Oath, or not, for beſides that ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary Clauſe is wont to comprehend only ſuch plain things, which are evident to any Mans ſences; and ſo are not liable to diſpute. So that this power of taking cognizance does not at all ſuppoſe any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction by which the Actions of the King as a Subject may be judged, but is nothing elſe, than a bare Declaration, whereby any Man takes notice that his manifeſt right is violated by another. See <hi>Grotius,</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 3. § 16. And <hi>Baecler,</hi> upon him: who are both of the ſame Opinion. <hi>Grotius</hi> indeed in the ſame place ſpeaks more obſcurely, when he ſays, That the Obligation ariſing from the promiſes of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50833:126"/> Kings, does either fall upon the exerciſe of the act, or alſo directly upon the very power of it, if he act contrary to promiſes of the former ſort; the act may be called unjuſt, and yet be valid; if againſt thoſe of the latter, it is alſo void, as if he ſhould have ſaid, Sometimes a King promiſes not to uſe part of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, but after acertain manner; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he plainly renounces ſome part thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which there are two things to be obſerved; firſt that alſo ſome acts may be void, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed contrary to an Obligation of the former ſorts; as for example, if a King ſwear not to impoſe any Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without the conſent of the Eſtates. I ſuppoſe that ſuch Taxes which the King ſhall Levy by his own will alone; to bevoid. Secondly, That in the latter form the parts of the ſupreme power, are divided.</p>
               <p>But that the Nature of limited Kingdoms may more thoroughly be underſtood; it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the affairs which occur in Governning a Common-wealth are of two kinds; for of ſome of them it may be agreed beforehand, becauſe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they happen they are ſtill but of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but of others, a certain Judgment cannot be made but at the time preſent, whether they are beneficial to the Publick or not; for that thoſe circumſtances which accompany them, cannot be forſeen. Yet concerning both, that People may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that he to whom they have commited this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Kingdom ſhould not depart from the Common good in the former, whilſt it preſcribes perpetual Laws or Conditions which the King ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obſerve in the latter, whilſt he is obliged to conſult the aſſembly of his People or Nobility. Thus the People being ſatisfied of the truth of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and what ſort of Eccleſiaſtical Government, or Ceremonies do beſt ſuit their Genius; ſo it is in <hi>Sweden,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:50833:127"/> may condition with the King upon his Inauguration, that he ſhall not change any thing in Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by his ſole Authority. So every Body being ſenſible, how often Juſtice would be injured, if Sentence ſhould always be given by the ſole Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prince, <hi>&amp; ex aequo &amp; hono,</hi> without any written or known Laws, and that Paſſion, <note place="margin">VI. <hi>Tacit An. L.</hi> 13. 4. 2.</note> Intereſt, or unskilfulneſs would have too great a ſway for avoiding this inconvenience, the people may oblige their King, that either he ſhall compoſe a Body of juſt Laws, or obſerve thoſe that are already extant and alſo that Judgment be given according to thoſe Laws, in certain Courts or Colledges of Juſtice, and that none but the moſt weighty Cauſes ſhould come before the King by way of Appeal. <note place="margin">This is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Law of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  </note> So likewiſe, ſince it is well known how eaſily Riches obtained by the Labour of others, may be ſquandered away by Luxury or Ambition: therefore the Subjects Goods ſhould not lie at their Princes mercy to ſuſtain their Luſts. Some Nations have wiſely aſſigned a certain Revenue to their Prince, ſuch as they ſuppoſed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the conſtant Charges of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; but if greater expences were neceſſary, they would have thoſe referred to the Aſſembly of Eſtates. And ſince alſo ſome Kings are more deſirous than they ought to be of Military Glory, and running themſelves into unneceſſary Wars, may put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Kingdoms in hazard, therefore ſome of them have been ſo cautious, that in the conferring the regal Dignity, they have impoſed this neceſſity upon their Kings, that if they would make offenſive Wars upon their Neighbours, they ſhould firſt adviſe with their great Council; and ſo likewiſe it might be ordained concerning other
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50833:127"/> matters, which the People judged neceſſary for the Common-wealth, leſt that if an abſolute power of ordering thoſe things, were left to the Prince, the common good of the People would perhaps be leſs conſidered.</p>
               <p>And ſince the people would not leave to this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited King an abſolute power in thoſe Acts which are thus excepted, but that an Aſſembly, either of the whole people, or of thoſe that repreſent them divided into their ſeveral Orders; it is further to be obſerved, that the power of this Council, or Aſſembly, is not alike every where. For in ſome places the King himſelf though every where abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, may have appointed a Council, or Senate, without whoſe approbation he will not have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to be valid. Which Senate without doubt will only have the Authority of Councellors, and though they may queſtion the Kings Grants or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and reject thoſe which they judg inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for the Common-wealth, yet they do not this by any inherent Right, but by a power granted them from the King himſelf. Who would this way prevent his decreeing any thing through haſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, or the perſwaſion of Flatterers that might prove hurtful to his State: to which may be referred what <hi>Plutarch</hi> mentions in his Apothegms. <q rend="inline">'That the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings obſerve a Law, <note place="margin">Note the Antiquity of of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Law.</note> whereby they oblige their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by Oath, that if the King require an unjuſt Sentence from them, they ſhould refuſe him.</q> And in the ſame place it is noted, that <hi>Antigonus</hi> 3. writ to his Cities, that if by his Letter he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand anything contrary to his Laws, they ſhould not obey it, but ſhould think he failed thorough ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or miſinformation; and oftentimes impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50833:128"/> Requeſts are cluded this way, whilſt the Prince ſeems for quietneſs ſake content to grant what he knows will be made void by this Senate or Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">As it hath been often in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> yet when the King is reſolved that his Will ſhall hold good, and looks upon the contrary Reaſons of this Parliament as not weighty enough to convince him, it cannot then any longer contradict the Kings Will; for it is not preſumed that the King by conſtituting ſuch a Court would irrevocably abdicate his Right of abſolute power. So that this Senate or Parliament hath indeed but a Derivative power from the King to be limited as he himſelf ſhall pleaſe, although perhaps he will not exert this power but upon weighty conſiderations, nor does this Court make the power of the King leſs than abſolute; ſince it only gives him occaſion to review his own Acts, and as it were Appeals from himſelf, when ſurpriſed with Paſſions Prejudices, or miſinformation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a more indifferent and conſiderate Temper. The like may be ſaid of the Aſſembly of Eſtates, if they meet only for this purpoſe that they ſhould be the Kings greateſt Council, by which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and complaints of his People, which often times are concealed in his private Council, may come to the Kings ears; who is then left free to Enact what he thinks expedient, <hi>Vid. Gro. Li.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. §. 10. But a Kingdom is truely limited, when the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at firſt conferred it on the King, on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ſhould aſſemble the Eſtates concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome Acts, without whoſe conſent this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſhould not be valid, yet it ought to be in the Kings power to call, and diſſolve this Aſſembly, and to propoſe the buſineſs to be diſpatcht therein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſhould go about to ſet up an irregular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50833:128"/> and leave the King no more than an empty Title, but if theſe States being ſo convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do of their own accord Propoſe thoſe things which they conceive conducing to the good and ſafety of the Kingdom, yet the Decrees or Acts conſtituted concerning them, take their force from the Kings paſſing them. Yet ſuch an aſſembly of Eſtates do differ from Counſellors properly taken in this, that although both of them can only move the King by reaſon only, yet the King may very well reject the Reaſons of theſe latter, but not of the former, neither ought the King to think himſelf contemned, if theſe Eſtates do not conſent to ſome things of his propoſing. For as he promiſed at firſt to have always before his Eyes the good of the Common-wealth, of which a great many choice men are ſuppoſed to Judg more certainly than one. A King may moſt commonly blame his own impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Paſſions, or ill Fortune, if the States hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to differ from him, from whence it likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that their fear is vain, who think that by this means, it is at the diſpoſal of the Eſtates, whether the Common-wealth ſhall be ſafe or not. For it can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed, that the King ſhould be ſo negligent, as to omit laying open to his Eſtates the neceſſities of the Kingdom, or that the Eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully ſatisfied of them, will ever go about to betray their own ſafety. But this is certain, ſince thoſe who have conferred the limited power cannot be preſumed either to intend to deſtroy or diſſolve the Common-wealth; or by their confederacy to order things ſo, that the end of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, cannot be obtained in it, therefore there ought to be that favourable interpretation made of thoſe Conventions that they really deſire the common ſafety, and would by no means
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50833:129"/> do any thing contrary thereunto; ſo likewiſe in making this compact, that whatſoever they have ſo agreed to, they are ſtill to be ſuppoſed to have that intention, that nothing ſhould be done by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe conditions or parts which ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the common ſafety, and publick utility, or whereby the Convulſion or Diſſolution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth might follow. But if ſuch a chance ſhould happen, it would be moſt convenient, that if the affair will allow of delay, it ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Aſſembly of Eſtates, but where this cannot be done, it may be the Kings Duty dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to correct thoſe complaints that may break out to the deſtruction of the Common-wealth, which alſo is of the the ſame force in reſpect of publick Laws, <note place="margin">

                  </note> which the ſafety of the people and the ſupream Law commands ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be ſilent.

               </p>
               <p>However, Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> will allow no diſtinction between limited power and abſolute, but will have all ſupreme power to be abſolute, when it is to be obſerved, that in all thoſe aſſertions which are too rudely laid down by him, there is a reſtriction to be added from the and of all Common-wealths, as in what he lays down in his <hi>de Cive cap.</hi> 5. §. 6. that he to whom in a Common-wealth there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the right of puniſhing, can by right compel all to all things he pleaſes, or as he expreſſes this limitation in the ſame place, which are neceſſary for the common peace and ſafety, and <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. §. 13. when by the right of the ſupreme Governour he ſays there is connected ſo great an obedience of all the Subjects as is requiſite for the Government of the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50833:129"/> Common-wealth, ſo when in the place aforegoing he ſaith, who ever hath ſo ſubjected his own will <q rend="inline">'to that of the Prince, that he may do whatever he pleaſes, without puniſhment, as alſo make Laws, Judg differences, puniſh whom he pleaſes, &amp; uſe the ſtrength &amp; power of all men according to his own will, perform all theſe things by the higheſt right, he hath then granted him the greateſt power which can be granted.</q> But it is now to be conſidered, by what intention, or on what grounds men were moved to inſtitute Common-wealths, from whence it is clear, that no body is underſtood to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred more power by his Will upon the Monarch, then a reaſonable man can judg neceſſary to that end: and that although the ordering what may conduce to this end in this or that occaſion, does not remain in thoſe that have transferred their power, but in him on whom that power is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, therefore the ſupream Ruler can compel the Subjects to all thoſe things which are really condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the good of the Common-wealth, but he ought not to go about to compel them to thoſe things that are contrary to the ſafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or againſt the Laws of Nature. And if he endeavours any ſuch thing, without doubt he tranſgreſſes the bounds of his power. Let us alſo conſider the Arguments by which the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his <hi>De Cive. Cap.</hi> 6, §. 17. endeavours to prove that all limitation of Soveraign power is abſolutely vain, he ſays that aſſembly which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Laws to the future King, muſt have had abſolute power, either habitually, or vertually. If the Aſſembly remains conſtantly, or adjourns their Meeting from Time to Time, to a certain day and place, their power will be perpetual, and ſo the King will not have the Supream power, but will be
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50833:130"/> only a bare Magiſtrate. Which we grant to be true, if that Aſſembly can meet by its own Right and Decree of any Affairs of the Common-wealth, and that the King be liable to give them an Account of his Actions. But if it abſolutely diſſolve it ſelf; unleſs the Commonwealth be likewiſe diſſolved, there muſt in like manner a power be left ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, of puniſhing thoſe that tranſgreſs the Laws, which without abſolute power cannot be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which is falſe as alſo the Argument by which he would prove it: for he who hath granted him by Right, ſo much power, that he can compel any of the Subjects by puniſhments, hath ſo great power that greater cannot be conferred by them. But for all this, whoever will but conſider the end of all Common-wealths, and that thoſe Subjects by the ſubmiſſion of their Wills and powers, did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately become ſenceleſs Machines: ſo that ſince they could grant the uſe of their united Forces to another upon condition, and are able to judg whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this condition be perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d or not, ſo they can likewiſe withdraw their Forces again upon the breach of the condition, as likewiſe this is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently falſe, that there is no better proviſion againſt the abuſe of Authority, when it is granted limited, then when it is left abſolute; for it is not who, that he who hath power enough to defend all Men. (which all that are not Fools will eaſily grant their Prince) as alſo power enough to deſtroy them. The Commands of a General which are ſufficient to make the Souldiers ſtout, to venture their Lives, againſt an Enemy, yet would be found of no force, if he ſhould command them to draw their Swords againſt each other. So that prudent and worthy Princes though abſolute, will comply with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins of their Subjects, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50833:130"/> to urge them too far though for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when they cannot be compelled to their Duty without ſome hazard to the Common-wealth. But thoſe Subjects are not leſs diſcreet, who when they are ſatisfied, what is not expedient for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, have provided by Fundamental Laws, that they ſhould not be compelled to it by their Princes power. So far ſpeaks the judicious Mr. <hi>Puſendorf</hi> upon this Subject, which though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prolix, I have thought fit to tranſlate verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe I would not be thought by going about to contract it, to put my own ſence upon his words, and beſides I know no man that hath writ more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this Subject, in avoiding on one ſide an abſolute deſpotick Monarchy, without falling into that Solaciſm in Politicks the diviſion of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power which he ſuppoſes truly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with Monarchy. So that if the Reader is not ſatisfied with what I have here writ upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: I am ſorry his underſtanding and mine are not framed alike, nor ſhall be angry with him, if he like an abſolute Monarchy better then that we live under. Provided, he will never Act any thing to produce publick diſturbances: or to introduce it, either by force or fraud in this Kingdom. Yet ſhall wiſh him no greater Prerogative, then that of enjoying his own opinion, without impoſing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, who are not yet weary of their Eſtates and Liberties, which ſince the People of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not yet weary of. The World is wide enough, and there are Countries, where this which they admire as the primitive Government of the World, and that which they perhaps Reverence as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Religion is practiſed in its full ſplendor: and indeed are moſt ſuitable to each other. All the hurt I wiſh thoſe Gentlemen, that they were all
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50833:131"/> ſetled in any of them, even which they like beſt. Whilſt all plain hearted Engliſh-men, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch ſubtile diſcourſes, as thofe of our Author, are reſolved to return the ſame Anſwer to them as the Temporal Lords did to the Biſhops long ſince upon another occaſion, <hi>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari,</hi> of which I hope there is as little fear, as there is or ever will be juſt occaſion for it. And ſo I ſhall quit my hands of this ungrateful task, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling my ſelf with his Diſcourſe of Witches. Since his other writings ſufficiently aſſure us that whatever he was in other Learning he was no Witch in Politicks, though he had Read Ariſtotle, might perhaps be better read in the Fathers and Schoolmen. or Civil-Law, than in the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or thoſe of his own Countrey.</p>
