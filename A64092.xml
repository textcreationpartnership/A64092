            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT may not be unknown to tho≈øe that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øant in Books and Pamphlets publi≈øhed during the late unhappy times, that all the Treati≈øes (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Patriarcha</hi>) which are the ≈øubject of the en≈øuing <hi>Ob≈øervations,</hi> were publi≈øhed at fir≈øt in ≈øingle Tracts without Name, though they have ≈øince come out under that of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> Baronet, decea≈øed: All which, though I hope they might be written with an hone≈øt de≈øigne, and in defence of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of his then Maje≈øties lawful and ju≈øt Rights, then trampled upon by a domineering Faction, and may contain ≈øome things u≈øeful enough to confute divers levelling Notions then too much in fa≈øhion; yet whil≈øt this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (as violent men commonly do) ran into the other extream, and mu≈øt needs a≈ø≈øert an Ab≈øolute Monarchy <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> ≈øo that no other Government can be lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed, nor the lea≈øt Limitations ≈øet to it, without Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and diminution of that Soveraignty which is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from no le≈øs an Original than God him≈øelf; and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that Princes can ever be obliged by any Fundamental, or after-Contracts, or Conce≈ø≈øions, or by any Coronation-Oaths, to ab≈øtain from the Lives, Liberties, or Properties of their Subjects, farther than as they them≈øelves ≈øhall think it convenient; ≈øo that there can be no ≈øuch thing in nature as a Tyrant: I leave it to the judgment of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader, whether what this Author might de≈øigne
<pb facs="tcp:50833:3"/> as Phy≈øick, hath not ≈øerved rather to inflame the Di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and whether he hath not by ≈øuch ra≈øh and ill-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded A≈ø≈øertions, given too much advantage to the Enemies of King≈øhip to retort, That ≈øince all Government was ordained by God for the good of Mankind, that could never be of divine in≈øtitution which would render all things to be ≈øo much the Princes Right, that the Subjects can claim a Property in nothing which he ≈øhall plea≈øe to take from them; and that however they u≈øe them, yet they ≈øtill exerci≈øe but their own Royal Rights and Prerogatives. So that by thus taking away all di≈øtinctions between Kings and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and between Slaves and Subjects, I fear that (like <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s har≈øh An≈øwer to his Peoples Complaints) he hath not given many of his Readers a prejudice again≈øt that Government, which temper'd by known Laws, I take to be the be≈øt in the World.</p>
            <p>For as Super≈øtition can never ≈øerve to advance the true Wor≈øhip of God, but by creating fal≈øe Notions of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature in mens minds, or render it not as it ought to be, the Object of their Love and Reverence, but ≈øervile Fear; ≈øo I ≈øuppo≈øe this a≈ø≈øerting of ≈øuch an unlimited Power in all Monarchs, and ≈øuch an entire Subjection as this Author exacts from Subjects, can produce nothing but a Slavi≈øh Dread, without that Reverence, E≈øteem, and Affection for their Princes Per≈øon and Government which is ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary for the quiet of Princes, and which they will have, whil≈øt they believe he thinks him≈øelf obliged in Con≈øcience and Honour to protect their Lives and Fortunes from Slavery and Oppre≈ø≈øion, according to ju≈øt and known Laws: And that contrary Notions of this Supreme Power, are ≈øo far from ≈øetling mens minds in a ≈øober and rational Obedience to Government, that they rather make them de≈øperate and carele≈øs who is their Ma≈øter, ≈øince let what change will come, they are ≈øure to be no better than Slaves, as may be ≈øeen in all the Ab≈øolute Monarchies from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may al≈øo con≈øider whether mo≈øt of the Arguments
<pb facs="tcp:50833:3"/> this Author makes u≈øe of for ab≈øolute Obedience to <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as repre≈øenting the lawful Prince and Father of the People, might not ≈øerve for the e≈øtabli≈øhing of <hi>Oliver</hi> and the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> as well as a lawful Soveraign; ≈øince I am ≈øure <hi>Milton</hi> makes u≈øe of the ≈øame places of Scripture for this purpo≈øe, which this Author and <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øius</hi> do for another.</p>
            <p>So that mo≈øt moderate men, nay, the Author's own Friends, may wi≈øh that either the≈øe Treati≈øes had never been publi≈øhed, or at lea≈øt have been left in private Studies and Book-≈øellers ≈øhops, among≈øt tho≈øe heaps of Pamphlets condemned to du≈øt and oblivion; ≈øince no man can imagine to what end this <hi>Patriarcha</hi> and other Tracts ≈øhould come out at ≈øuch a <hi>Time</hi> as they did, unle≈øs the Publi≈øhers thought that the≈øe Pieces, which printed apart could onely ≈øerve to en≈ønare the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtandings of ≈øome unthinking Country-Gentleman or Windblown-Theologue, could do no le≈øs, being twi≈øted into one Volume, than bind the Con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and en≈ølave the Rea≈øons of all his unwary Readers.</p>
            <p>Since therefore ≈øhort Treati≈øes of this kind, written in a gentile ≈øtile, and a formal appearance of Law and Rea≈øon, do more mi≈øchief among young men, and tho≈øe that have not lei≈øure to look much into the grounds of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie, than tedious Volumes: And that this Notion of the Divine and Patriarchal Right of ab≈øolute Monarchy hath obtain'd ≈øo much among ≈øome modern Church-men, who cry it up as their <hi>Diana,</hi> and con≈øequently hath ≈øo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected our <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øities, that are the Seminaries where the Youth of this Nation do commonly receive Principles both in Religion and Politicks, which if they have not a mind large enough to overcome the prejudices of Education, will mi≈ø-lead them as long as they live, and ≈øo make them de≈øire at lea≈øt to alter that Government, and give up tho≈øe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which their Ance≈øtors were ≈øo careful to pre≈øerve and deliver down to Po≈øterity: I thought my ≈øelf obliged (having perhaps more lei≈øure, though le≈øs parts and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:50833:4"/> than a great many others) to do God, my King, and Country this ≈øervice, as to lay open the weakne≈øs of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and the dangerous con≈øequences of this Author's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And though men of greater abilities may either di≈øpi≈øe ≈øuch weak Arguments as this Author makes u≈øe of, or el≈øe think it below them to ≈øpend ≈øo much time from their more u≈øeful and beneficial Employments, and that indeed his Rea≈øons are not ≈øo knotty or intricate, that they require any more than hone≈øt ≈øence and plain Engli≈øh to lay them open to the unprejudiced Reader; yet ≈øince the Poy≈øon hath ≈øpread ≈øo far among the men of Letters, and in the Country among divers of the Gentry and Clergie, I thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øs to do my weak endeavour to undeceive them: And in ≈øo doing, I de≈øire to be thought no other than what I really am, a zealous a≈ø≈øertor and defender of the Government e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øht by Law; being ≈øo far from a Commonwealths-man, that for my own part I reverence Monarchy above all other forms of Government, and ≈øhould be as willing to have it unmixt (it being that by which God Almighty governs the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øe) could humane nature be long tru≈øted with it, and could we be as certain that his Vicegerents on Earth would as ea≈øily imitate tho≈øe divine Attributes of wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs, as they are prone to lay claim to his ab≈øolute Power. For as where tho≈øe Perfections direct the Scepter, a Prince is to be loved and reverenced as the be≈øt Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the divine nature; ≈øo the exerci≈øe of an ab≈øolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power, without the≈øe, can create no other Idea in mens minds, than what the barbarous <hi>Indians</hi> have of tho≈øe terrible Gods they wor≈øhip, to whom though they often make Oblations of what is deare≈øt to them, yet it is upon no higher motive of Devotion, than that they thereby hope to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole them not to do them any mi≈øchief, and would ≈øoon ca≈øt them off if they knew how to get rid of them. Therefore the fault is not in the Government as ab≈øolute, but in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, which is not often found ≈øufficient, at lea≈øt for above one or two Succe≈ø≈øions, to ≈øupport and manage ≈øo
<pb facs="tcp:50833:4"/> unlimited a Power in one ≈øingle per≈øon as it ought to be. And for this I de≈øire the Reader to look over the Catalogue of all the <hi>Per≈øian, Roman,</hi> and <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Monarchs that have ever ≈øucceeded in ≈øo many hundreds of years, and ≈øee how many good ones they will finde among them, and who truly con≈øidered the good and pro≈øperity of that Empire which God had tru≈øted them withal; the effects of which ab≈øolute Power being very well known to the Satyri≈øt who lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, when he thus ≈øhrewdly ob≈øerves:
<q>
                  <l>‚Äî Nihil e≈øt quod credere de ≈øe</l>
                  <l>Non po≈ø≈øit, cum laudatur Diis aequa pote≈øtas.</l>
                  <bibl>Juven. Sat. 4.</bibl>
               </q> And how much Chri≈øtian Religion hath altered the ca≈øe, I de≈øire all ob≈øerving Readers to con≈øult the late Hi≈øtories of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Mu≈øcovy,</hi> and other de≈øpotick Governments in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ≈øince the Government of this Nation, as now e≈øtabli≈øht, I conceive the be≈øt in its kind, as mo≈øt equal and beneficial both to the Prince and People; ≈øo that it is onely their faults who would go off from it, if they are not both Prince and People the happie≈øt in the World: I hope I may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øin, wi≈øh tho≈øe accur≈øed from God, who would remove our ancient Land-marks, and pull up all Limits between Prerogative and Law; and who (as it may ju≈øtly be feared) would mi≈ø-lead Princes, en≈ølave Mankind, and (if occa≈øion were) ≈øacrifice both to their own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øts and Ambition.

               <p>THE rea≈øon why I chu≈øe to begin the≈øe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations with this Treati≈øe of the natural Right of Kings, rather than with any of the re≈øt, though publi≈øhed long before it, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe being (as I ≈øuppo≈øe) writ after the re≈øt, and on purpo≈øe to a≈ø≈øert Monarchy to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> is likely to contain the Authors mo≈øt mature thoughts; and being written with better connection than his other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50833:6"/> Tracts, contains the ≈øub≈øtance of them all; which were de≈øigned not ≈øo much to e≈øtabli≈øh an Hypothe≈øis, as to ob≈øerve the weakne≈øs of other mens: and being publi≈øhed at ≈øeveral times, and on divers occa≈øions, give us but the ≈øame Notions repeated, according as the Tenets in the Authors he writ again≈øt needed (as he thought) a Confutation: Which how far they do de≈øerve it, I leave to the Reader to judge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øhall not take upon me to defend any mans Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, though never ≈øo great or learned, farther than I conceive them agreeable to right Rea≈øon. Nor ≈øhall I trouble my ≈øelf to criticize on every ≈ømall Errour or Mi≈øtake in this Author's Writings, but onely ≈øet my ≈øelf to con≈øider ≈øuch main Arguments as appear to be founded on fal≈øe or meer precarious Principles; not concerning my ≈øelf with his other Treati≈øes, but as they contain ≈øome other Rea≈øons or newer Matter than I finde here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 2. The de≈øigne of this Treati≈øe, is again≈øt an Opinion maintained by ≈øome Divines, and ≈øeveral learned men, That Mankind is naturally endowed and born with Freedom from Subjection, and at liberty to chu≈øe what form of Government it plea≈øe; and that the Power which any one man hath over others, was at fir≈øt be≈øtowed according to the di≈øcretion of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. <hi>Page</hi> 3. This Opinion, he ≈øays, is not to be found in the Fathers of the Primitive Church: that it contradicts the Doctrine and Hi≈øtory of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the con≈øtant practice of all ancient Monarchies, and the very Principles of the Law of Nature. And upon this Doctrine the Je≈øuits, and favourers of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Di≈øcipline, have built this perilous Conclu≈øion: That the People or Multitude have power to puni≈øh or deprive the Prince, if he tran≈øgre≈øs the Laws of the Kingdom. And for this quotes the Writings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Je≈øuits.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50833:6"/>
               <p>How far this Tenet de≈øerves the Author's Cen≈øure, and is liable to the Conclu≈øions he ≈øays ≈øome have drawn from thence, ≈øince the truth or fal≈øhood of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions does not depend upon the men that have made u≈øe of them, I ≈øhall con≈øider hereafter; now confining my ≈øelf onely to examine the Rea≈øons he brings either in this or any other of his Treati≈øes to overthrow this Opinion. And if they prove weak, and in≈øufficient for the end the Author de≈øigned them, ≈øome Friend of his, or his Tenets, had be≈øt finde out others; which if they prove and appear evidently true, I ≈øhall then re≈øt ≈øatisfied, and acknowledge my ≈øelf ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely convinced. In the mean time I ≈øhall now give you the Author's Hypothe≈øis all at once, in his words, that you may judge whether I deal fairly with him or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 5. To pa≈øs over therefore his Cautions (which are hone≈øt and ≈øober) I ≈øhall come to what he ob≈øerves upon ≈øeveral pa≈ø≈øages of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> And though he does not quote the places from whence he took them, yet I hope he hath dealt fairly with him: Though I ≈øhall not take upon me to defend the contradictions or fal≈øe con≈øequences either of this or any other Author, ≈øince I onely ob≈øerve the onely An≈øwer which (<hi>p.</hi> 11.) Sir <hi>R. F.</hi> gives <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Argument for the natural Liberty of the People, is out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him≈øelf, who≈øe words are the≈øe: <hi>If many men had been created together out of the Earth, they ought all to have been Princes over their Po≈øterity. In which words</hi> (the Author ≈øays) <hi>we have an evident confe≈ø≈øion, that Creation made Man Prince of his Po≈øterity. And indeed not onely</hi> Adam, <hi>but the ≈øucceeding Patriarchs had by right of Fatherhood, Royal Authority over their Children. Nor dares</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>deny this. That the Patriarchs</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>were endowed with Kingly power, their deeds do te≈øtifie; for as</hi> Adam <hi>was Lord of his Children, ≈øo his Children, under him, had a Command and Power over their own Children:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50833:7"/> but ≈øtill with a ≈øubordination to the fir≈øt Parent, who was Lord Paramount over his Childrens Children to all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as being the Grandfather of his People.</hi> Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> though it may de≈øtroy his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for natural Freedom, yet I conceive that it does not de≈øtroy the nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øuppo≈øing all the Kingdoms and Commonwealths now in being in the world, to have had their beginning from Conque≈øt, or el≈øe from the Con≈øent or In≈øtitution of the People who began it; as I ≈øhall endeavour to prove more at large.</p>
               <p>But from this conce≈ø≈øion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s, the Author taking this as a yielded point, proceeds thus: <hi>P.</hi> 12. <hi>I do not ≈øee how the Children of</hi> Adam, <hi>or any man el≈øe, can be free from Subjection to their Parents: And this Subjection of Children being the Fountain of all Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by the Ordination of God him≈øelf, it follows, That Civil Power not onely in general is by Divine In≈øtitution, but even the A≈ø≈øignment of it ≈øpecifically to the elde≈øt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Which quite takes away that new and common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction which refers onely Power <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øal and Ab≈øolute to God; but Power Re≈øpective, in regard of the ≈øpecial Form of Government, to the Choice of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 13. <hi>This Lord≈øhip which</hi> Adam <hi>by command had over the whole World, and by right de≈øcending from him, the Patriarchs did enjoy, was as large and ample as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute≈øt Dominion of any Monarch which hath been ≈øince the Creation. For Power of Life and Death, we finde that</hi> Judah <hi>the Father pronounced ≈øentence of death again≈øt</hi> Thamar <hi>his Daughter-in-law for playing the Harlot;</hi> Bring her forth <hi>(≈øaith he)</hi> that ≈øhe may be burnt. <hi>Touching War, we ≈øee that</hi> Abram <hi>commanded an Army of</hi> 318 <hi>Souldiers of his own Family; and</hi> E≈øau <hi>met his brother</hi> Jacob <hi>with</hi> 400 <hi>men at Arms. For matter of Peace,</hi> Abraham <hi>made a League with</hi> Abimelech, <hi>and ratified the Articles with an Oath. The≈øe Acts of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in capital Crimes, of making War, and concluding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50833:7"/> Peace, are the chiefe≈øt Marks of Soveraignty that are found in any Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And not onely until the Flood, but after it, this Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal power did continue, as the very name</hi> Patriarch <hi>doth in part prove. The three Sons of</hi> Noah <hi>had the whole World divided among≈øt them by their Father; for of them was the whole World over≈øpread, according to the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction given to him and his Sons:</hi> Be fruitful, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and repleni≈øh the earth.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds upon a vulgar Opinion, <hi>p.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>That at the Confu≈øion of Tongues, there were</hi> 72 <hi>di≈øtinct Nations erected, not as confu≈øed Multitudes, without Heads or Governours, but they were di≈øtinct Families which had Fathers for Rulers over them: whereby it appears, that even in the Confu≈øion, God was careful to pre≈øerve Paternal Authority, by di≈øtributing the diver≈øity of Languages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diver≈øity of Families.</hi> And for this he quotes the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. v. 5. Speaking of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the I≈øles of the Gentiles among the Sons of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>The≈øe are the Families of the Sons of</hi> Noah, <hi>after their Generations in their Nations; and by the≈øe were the≈øe Nations divided in the Earth after the Flood. So that though the manner of this Divi≈øion be uncertain, yet it is mo≈øt certain the Divi≈øion it ≈øelf was by Families from</hi> Noah <hi>and his Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 16. As for <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s being King over his own Family by Right, and over other Families by U≈øurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conque≈øt, and not by Election of the People or Multitude, he gives us Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it was ≈øo; (which I think is no better a proof than if he had given us his own:) but if it were true, it proves no more, than that this Patriarchal Right could not long continue, ≈øince it was u≈øurped in the Grandchild of <hi>Ham,</hi> the fourth di≈øcent from <hi>Noah.</hi> But he proceeds thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As this Patriarchal Power continued in</hi> Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaac,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50833:8"/> 
                  <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>even unto the Egyptian Bondage; ≈øo we finde it among≈øt the Sons of</hi> I≈ømael <hi>and</hi> E≈øau: <hi>it is ≈øaid,</hi> The≈øe are the Sons of <hi>I≈ømael,</hi> and the≈øe are their names by their Ca≈øtles and Towns, Twelve Princes of their Tribes and Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 18. He owns this Paternal Government was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted during their Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> becau≈øe they were in ≈øubjection to a ≈øtronger Prince: <hi>But after the return of the</hi> I≈øraelites <hi>out of bondage, God, out of a ≈øpecial care of them, cho≈øe</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>and</hi> Jo≈øuah <hi>≈øucce≈ø≈øively to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern as Princes, in≈øtead of the ≈øupream Fathers: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, God rai≈øed up Judges to defend his People. But when God gave them Kings, he re-e≈øtabli≈øhed the ancient and prime Right of Lineal-≈øucce≈ø≈øion to Paternal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And when≈øoever he made choice of any ≈øpecial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to be King, he intended that the I≈ø≈øue al≈øo ≈øhould have the benefit thereof, as being comprehended ≈øufficiently in the per≈øon of the Father, although the Father onely was named in the Grant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 19. The Author proceeds to obviate an Objection that he ≈øees may be made to his Hypothe≈øis, That it may ≈øeem ab≈øurd that Kings now are Fathers of their People ≈øince Experience ≈øhews the contrary. <hi>It is true</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>all Kings are not the natural Parents of their Subjects, yet they all either are, or are to be reputed the next Heirs to tho≈øe fir≈øt Progenitors who were at fir≈øt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parents of the whole People; and ≈øo in their right ≈øucceed to the exerci≈øe of Supream Juri≈ødiction: and ≈øuch Heirs are not onely Lords of their own Children, but of their Brethren, and all others</hi> that were Subjects to <hi>their Fathers. And therefore we finde that God told</hi> Cain <hi>of his brother</hi> Abel, His de≈øires ≈øhall be toward thee, and thou ≈øhalt rule over him. <hi>Accordingly when</hi> Jacob <hi>bought his brothers Birthright,</hi> I≈øaac <hi>ble≈ø≈øed him thus:</hi> Be Lord over thy brethren, and let the ≈øons of thy mother bow before thee.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50833:8"/>
               <p>P. 20. <hi>As long as the fir≈øt Fathers of Families lived, the name of Patriarch did aptly belong unto them; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few De≈øcents, when the true Fatherhood it ≈øelf was extinct, and onely the right of the Father de≈øcended upon the true Heir, then the Title of Prince or King was more ≈øignificant to expre≈øs the power of him who ≈øucceeds onely to the right of Fatherhood which his Ance≈øtors did naturally enjoy. By this means it comes to pa≈øs that many a Child, by ≈øucceeding a King, hath a right of a Father over many a gray-headed Multitude, and hath the Title of</hi> Pater Patriae.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be demanded, What becomes of the Right of Fatherhood, in ca≈øe the Crown does e≈øcheat for want of an Heir; whether doth it not then devolve to the People? The An≈øwer is, It is but the negligence or ignorance of the People to lo≈øe the knowledge of the true Heir: for an Heir there is always. If</hi> Adam <hi>him≈øelf were ≈øtill living, and now ready to die, it is certain that there is one man, and but one in the world, who is next Heir, although the knowledge who ≈øhould be that one man, be quite lo≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 21. <hi>This ignorance of the People being admitted, it doth not by any means follow, that for want of Heirs the Supream Power is devolved to the Multitude, or that they have power to rule, and chu≈øe what Rulers they plea≈øe. No, the Kingly power in ≈øuch ca≈øes e≈øcheats to the Princes and independent Heads of Families: for every Kingdom is re≈øolved into tho≈øe parts whereof at fir≈øt it was made. By the uniting of great Families or petty Kingdoms, we finde the greater Monarchies were at fir≈øt erected; and into ≈øuch again, as into their fir≈øt matter, many times they return again. And becau≈øe the dependancy of ancient Families is oft an ob≈øure and worn-out knowledge, there the wi≈ødom of many Princes have thought fit to adopt tho≈øe for Heads of Families, and Princes of Provinces, who≈øe Merits, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or Fortunes, have enabled them, or made them fit and capable of ≈øuch Royal Favours. All ≈øuch prime Heads
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50833:9"/> and Fathers have power to con≈øent in the uniting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of their Fatherly Right of Soveraign Authority on whom they plea≈øe: And he that is ≈øo elected, claims not his power as a Donative from the People, but as being ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted by God, from whom he receives his Royal Charter of an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øal Father, though te≈øtified by the Mini≈øtry of the Heads of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 22. <hi>In all Kingdoms or Commonwealths in the world, whether the Prince be the Supreame Father of the People, or but the true Heir of ≈øuch a Father,</hi> p. 23. <hi>or whether he come to the Crown by u≈øurpation of the Nobles, or of the People, or by any other way what≈øoever; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øome few or a multitude govern the Commonwealth; yet ≈øtill the Authority that is in any one, or in many, or in all the≈øe, is the onely Right and natural Authority of a Supream Father. There is, and always ≈øhall be continued to the end of the world, a natural Right of a Supream Father over a multitude, although by the ≈øecret Will of God, many do at fir≈øt mo≈øt unju≈øtly obtain the Exerci≈øe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To confirm this natural Right of Regal Power, we finde in the Decalogue, that the Law which enjoyns Obedience to Kings, is delivered in the Terms of,</hi> Honour thy Father and thy Mother: <hi>as if all Power were originally in the Father. If Obedience to Parents be due immediately by a natural Law and Subjection to Princes, but by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an humane Ordinance, what rea≈øon is there that the Laws of Nature ≈øhould give place to the Laws of Men? as we ≈øee the power of the Father over his Child, gives place, and is ≈øubordinate to the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 24. <hi>If we compare Rights of a Father with tho≈øe of a King, we finde them all one, without any difference at all, but onely in the latitude or extent of them: As the Father over one Family, ≈øo the King as Father over many Families, extends his care to pre≈øerve, feed, clothe, in≈øtruct,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50833:9"/> and defend the whole Commonwealth. His War, his Peace, his Courts of Ju≈øtice, and all his Acts of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tend onely to pre≈øerve and di≈øtribute to every ≈øubordinate and inferiour Father, and to their Children their Rights and Priviledges; ≈øo that all the Duties of a King are ≈øummed up in an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øal Fatherly Care of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been ≈øo ju≈øt to the Author as to tran≈øcribe as much of his fir≈øt Chapter as tends to prove the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power of Kings, as well that you might ≈øee the Hypothe≈øis which he builds his Divine Right of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute Monarchy in his own words, and ≈øo be the better able to judge whether I under≈øtand and an≈øwer him or not; as becau≈øe it contains the ≈øub≈øtance and ≈øtrength of all that the Author had to ≈øay in defence of it.</p>
               <p>So that I ≈øhall now fall to examine whether his Foundations will bear ≈øo weighty a Structure as he hath rai≈øed upon it. His fir≈øt Argument again≈øt the natural Freedom of Mankinde is drawn from Scripture, and from <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s own Conce≈ø≈øion, <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>was (and con≈øequently every other Father ought to be) a Prince over his Po≈øterity. And as</hi> Adam <hi>was Lord over his Children, ≈øo his Children, under him, had a power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their own Children, ≈øuberdinately to the fir≈øt Parent, who was Lord Paramount over his Childrens Children to all Generations, as being the Grandfather of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that neither the Children of</hi> Adam <hi>or any el≈øe, can be free from ≈øubjection to their Parents; and this ≈øubjection to Parents being the foundation of all Legal Authority, by the Ordination of God him≈øelf: therefore no man can be born in a ≈øtate of Freedom or Equality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In an≈øwer to which, I ≈øhall not concern my ≈øelf what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other have granted; but would be glad to know where and how God hath given this Ab≈øolute power to Fathers over their Children, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50833:10"/> by what Law Children are tyed to an Ab≈øolute Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Servitude to their Parents, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Preface to his Ob≈øervations on</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtotle<hi>'s Politicks.</hi>

               <p>The Author, in his Ob≈øervations on <hi>Grotius de Jure belli,</hi> &amp;c. founds this dominion of <hi>Adam</hi> over the Earth and all Creatures therein, on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. and quotes Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Mare Clau≈øum;</hi> where he ≈øays, <hi>That</hi> Adam, <hi>by donation from God, was made the general Lord of all things, not without ≈øuch a private dominion to him≈øelf as did exclude his Children,</hi> &amp;c. From which words I do not conceive that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ab≈øolute power over his own Off-≈øpring can be made out; for the words are ≈øpoken as well to the Female as Male of Mankind: <hi>Be fruitful and multiply, and repleni≈øh the Earth, and have dominion over the fi≈øh of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and over every living thing that moveth</hi> (in the Original, <hi>creepeth) upon the face of the Earth.</hi> By which words <hi>Adam</hi> hath no power conferred upon him over his own Children (when he ≈øhould have them:) The≈øe words implying no more than a conferring of a power by God on Mankind, under the≈øe words of <hi>Male and Female</hi> (and was not at all per≈øonal to <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi> alone) whereby they might ≈øubdue or tame the Brute Creatures for their u≈øe, not comprehending tho≈øe of the ≈øame kind with them≈øelves; ≈øince the general words extend no farther than to every living thing that <hi>creepeth</hi> upon the Earth: nor does Gods grant of the Creatures to <hi>Noah</hi> comprehend more than this: One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God there gives man a priviledge to kill the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for Food, which <hi>Adam</hi> had not. Which ≈øhews that <hi>Adam</hi> was ≈øo far from having any ≈øuch power of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50833:10"/> Life and Death over his own Children, that he had it not ≈øo much as over Brute Creatures: Since if he had this power as a Monarch, it is highly probable, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father of all Men in the world, and having by the murder of <hi>Abel</hi> not onely lo≈øt a Son but a Subject, it had been his Right alone to have puni≈øhed <hi>Cain</hi> the Murderer: Whereas we finde <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 14. upon his conviction of the Murder, telling God, that <hi>every one</hi> that findeth him, ≈øhould ≈ølay him; and therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 15. God ≈øet a mark upon <hi>Cain,</hi> le≈øt <hi>any</hi> finding him ≈øhould ≈ølay him. From whence we may infer, 1. That it was a Law of Nature then, that Murder was to be puni≈øhed. 2. That this Right of puni≈øhing did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Adam,</hi> as a Father, alone, ≈øo as to have power of Life and Death over his Children, ≈øince the Text does not mention that he was afraid his Father ≈øhould put him to death, but every one that met him: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does God ≈øet a mark upon him to ≈øecure him from <hi>Adam,</hi> but from any body el≈øe that ≈øhould light on him. From whence it follows, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had no more right by Gods conce≈ø≈øion to take away his Sons life for the murder of his Brother, (which is one of the greate≈øt offences he could commit) than any other of his Brethren or Kin≈ømen; there is no rea≈øon why he ≈øhould have it in any other ca≈øe. And as for what the Author ≈øays, <hi>That this Lord≈øhip which</hi> Adam <hi>had over the whole World, the Patriarchs by a Right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcending from him, did enjoy; which was as large and ample as the ab≈øolute≈øt Dominion of any Monarch which hath been ≈øince the Creation;</hi> I cannot under≈øtand how this Right derives it ≈øelf from <hi>Adam:</hi> For he tells us but a little before, <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>That Civil Power not onely in general is by divine In≈øtitution, but even the A≈ø≈øignment of it ≈øpecifically to the elde≈øt Parents.</hi> Therefore granting that all the Patriarchs from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s twelve Sons, inclu≈øively, a≈ø≈øumed a power of Life and Death
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50833:11"/> over their own Families, 1. I de≈øire to know how this Right can be derived from <hi>Adam:</hi> for the Right of ≈øupream Monarch of the world de≈øcending upon the elde≈øt Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom we will ≈øuppo≈øe to have been <hi>Seth</hi> (≈øince <hi>Cain</hi> might forfeit his Birthright,) this power of Life and Death could onely be truly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted in the elde≈øt Grandchild, or de≈øcendant from <hi>Seth;</hi> which I ≈øuppo≈øe the Author means by <hi>elde≈øt Parents,</hi> or el≈øe he talks non≈øence: And that <hi>Abraham</hi> was this elde≈øt Grand-≈øon of <hi>Seth,</hi> will be hard to prove, ≈øince it is not apparent from Scripture, whether <hi>Shem</hi> or <hi>Japhet</hi> were the elde≈øt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Abram</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi> the elde≈øt Son of <hi>Terah.</hi> And the Fathers and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Commentators on this place, are divided in their opinions concerning this point. And it is plain from divers places in Scripture, that the elde≈øt Son is not always fir≈øt named. But ≈øuppo≈øing that <hi>Shem</hi> was the elde≈øt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> it does not appear that <hi>Arphaxad</hi> from whom <hi>Abram</hi> de≈øcended, was his elde≈øt Son, ≈øince the Scripture does not undertake to give us the names of all the Sons of <hi>Shem,</hi> but onely of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> as his name was nece≈ø≈øary for the deriving of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Ance≈øtor of the Jewi≈øh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if any man will an≈øwer (as the Author does, <hi>p.</hi> 21.) that this right Heir of <hi>Adam</hi> coming by length of time to be lo≈øt, this ≈øupream Kingly power became devolved to all independent Heads of Families; then this Right of <hi>Adam,</hi> as Lord and King of the whole World, as the fir≈øt man, mu≈øt certainly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, ≈øince none but the true Heir could have a Right to that (according to the Author's principles:) So that this power of Life and Death which the Author will have the Patriarchs to have exerci≈øed over tho≈øe of their Family, mu≈øt belong to them either as Fathers, or el≈øe as Ma≈øters, or Heads of their particular Families; and not as Heirs to <hi>Adam.</hi> But ≈øince the Author ≈øeems

Yet though I will not deny, but ≈øome Gratitude and Acknwledgment is due from Children to Parents, even for this, that they did enter into the ≈øtate of Marriage for their generation, and were the occa≈øion of their Being: Yet I do not ≈øee, how by this alone a Father acquires an ab≈øolute power and dominion over the per≈øon of the Child, to di≈øpo≈øe of it as he thinks fit: Since Parents acting here only as Natural, and not Moral Agents, they are not the voluntary Cau≈øes of its generation: Therefore I cannot found ≈øo great a Right as that of an ab≈øolute perpetual Dominion over the Children, upon ≈øo ≈ølight a foundation.</p>
               <p>We mu≈øt therefore trace this Right of Fathers over his Children to a more true original than any of the≈øe. Since then all the Laws of Nature, or Rea≈øon, are intended for one end or effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the common good and pre≈øervation of Mankinde; and that Marriage is no otherwi≈øe a Duty, than as by the propagation of our Species it conduces to, without the help and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of others; and that the Parents entred into this ≈øtate of Marriage for the procreation of Children: both the In≈øtinct of Nature and Law of Rea≈øon dictate, that they are obliged to take care of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50833:13"/> and provide for that Child, which they as ≈øubordinate Cau≈øes have <hi>produced;</hi> as being tho≈øe on whom God hath impo≈øed this Duty, which is much greater than that of Generation: for now the world is ≈øufficiently peopled, it may be doubted, whether any per≈øon is obliged to Marry, further than it may con≈øi≈øt with their conveniency, or cour≈øe of Life. But Parents, when they are Married, are tyed by the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to take care of the Children. Therefore I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe the highe≈øt Right of Parents in their Children, doth ari≈øe merely from their di≈øcharge of this great Duty of Education, as may appear from this In≈øtance. Suppo≈øe the Parents not being willing to undertake the trouble of breeding up the Child, do either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe it, or pa≈øs over their Right in it to another, a≈ø≈øoon as it is born; I de≈øire to know if the per≈øon that finds this Child, or he to whom it is a≈ø≈øigned, breed it up until it come to have the u≈øe of Rea≈øon, what Duty this Child can owe his Parents, if they are made known to him? Certainly, all the obligation he can have to them, mu≈øt be upon the ≈øcore of their begetting him; which how ≈ømall that is, you may ob≈øerve from what hath been ≈øaid before: nor can the Parents claim any further Right in this Child, ≈øince by their expo≈øing and granting it away, they renounced all the Intere≈øt they could have in it; ≈øo that the Duty and Gratitude he ≈øhould have owed them, had they taken upon them the care and trouble of breeding him up, is now due to his Fo≈øter-Father or Mother, who took care of him until he was able to ≈øhift for him≈øelf. From whence it is evident, that the highe≈øt Right which Parents can have in their Children, is not meerly natural, from generation; but acquir'd by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that nobler part of their Duty. And ≈øo the highe≈øt Obedience which Children owe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, proceeds from that Gratitude and Sen≈øe they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50833:13"/> ought to have of the great obligation they owe their Parents, for the trouble and care they put them to in their Education.</p>
               <p>Having now, I hope, found out the Original of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Right and Intere≈øt in their Children, and the chief ground of their Gratitude and Duty to their Parents; we will now proceed to the Second Point propo≈øed, and con≈øider what kinde of Right this is, and how far it extends. Since therefore the Father's greate≈øt intere≈øt in his Child proceeds from his having bred it up, and taken care of it, and that this Duty is founded on that great Law of Nature, that every Man ought to endeavour the common good of Mankinde, which he performs, as far as lies in his power, in bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up, and taking care of his Child; it follows, that this right in the Child, or power over it, extends no farther than as it conduces to this end, that is, the good and pre≈øervation thereof: and when this Rule is tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed, the Right cea≈øes. For God hath not delivered one man into the power of another, merely to be tyrannized over at his plea≈øure; but that the per≈øon who hath this Authority, may u≈øe it for the good of tho≈øe he governs. And herein lies the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Intere≈øt which a Father hath in his Children, and that property which he hath in his Hor≈øes or Slaves; ≈øince his right to the former extends only to tho≈øe things that conduce to their Good and Benefit; but in the other he hath no other con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but the profit he may reap from their labour and ≈øervice, being under no other obligation but that of Humanity, and of u≈øing them as becomes a good-natur'd and merciful man; yet ≈øtill con≈øidering and intending his own advantage, as the principal end of his keeping of them. Whereas in his Children he is chiefly to de≈øign their good and advantage, as far as lies in his power, without ruining him≈øelf: and though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50833:14"/> he ju≈øtly may make u≈øe of their labour and ≈øervice while they continue as part of his Family; yet it is not for the ≈øame end alone that he u≈øes his Hor≈øes or Slaves, but that his Children being bred up in a con≈øtant cour≈øe of Indu≈øtry, may be the better able either to get their own living, or el≈øe to ≈øpend their time as they ought to do, without falling into the Vices of Idlene≈øs or Debauchery. So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Father has no more right over the Life of his Child than another man; being as much an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God if he abu≈øe this Right of a Father, in killing his innocent Son, as if another had done it. Neither hath he from the ≈øame Principles any right to maim or ca≈øtrate his Child, (as this Author allows him to do, in his Directions for Obedience;) much le≈øs ≈øell him for a Slave: Therefore it is no part of the Law of Nature, (unle≈øs he cannot otherwi≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for it) but of the <hi>Roman,</hi> or Civil-Law, that a Father ≈øhould have power to ≈øell his Son three times. For the Father is appointed by God to meliorate the condition of his Child, but not to make it wor≈øe; ≈øince it is not him≈øelf, but God that properly gave him his being. So that I hope I have ≈øufficiently proved there is a great difference between a Child and a Slave, or a Servant for Life, though this Authour will have them in the ≈øtate of Nature to be all one.</p>
               <p>But, for the better clearing of this point, how far the power of Parents over their Children extends, I think we may very well divide (as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> does) the life of the Child into three periods or ages. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De J.B.</hi> l. 2. c. 5. ¬ß 2.</note> The fir≈øt is the time of imperfect judgment, or before the Child comes to be able to exerci≈øe his Rea≈øon. The ≈øecond is the period of perfect Judgment, yet whil≈øt the Child ≈øtill continues part of his Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The third is after he hath left his Father's,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50833:14"/> and either enters into another Family, or ≈øets up a Family him≈øelf. In the fir≈øt Period, all the actions of Children are under the ab≈øolute dominion of their Parents: for ≈øince they have not the u≈øe of Rea≈øon, nor are able to judge what is good or bad for them≈øelves, they could not grow up nor be pre≈øerved, unle≈øs their Parents judged for them what means conduced to this end; yet this power is ≈øtill to be directed for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end, the good and pre≈øervation of the Child. In the ≈øecond Period, when they are of mature Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet continue part of their Fathers Family, they are ≈øtill under their Fathers command, and ought to be obedient to it in all actions which tend to the good of their Fathers Family and concerns; and in both the≈øe Ages the Father hath a power to ≈øet his Children to work, as well to enable them to get their own Living, as to recompence him≈øelf for the pains and care he hath taken, and the charge he may have bin at in their Education. For though he were obliged by the Law of Nature to breed up his Children, yet there is no rea≈øon but he may make u≈øe of their labour, as a natural recompence for his trouble. And in this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod the Father hath power to correct his Son, if he prove negligent, or di≈øobedient; ≈øince this Correction is for his advantage, to make him more careful and diligent another time, and to ≈øubdue the ≈øtubbornne≈øs of his Will: But in other actions the Children have a power of acting freely, yet ≈øtill with re≈øpect of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and plea≈øing their Parents, to whom they are obliged for their Being and Education, ≈øince without their care they could not have attained to that age. But ≈øince this Duty is not by force of any ab≈øolute Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only of Piety, Gratitude and Ob≈øervance, it does not make void any act, though done contrary to tho≈øe Duties, as Marriage, and the like; for the gift of a thing is not therefore void, though made contrary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50833:15"/> to the Rule of Prudence and Frugality. In the third Period, they are in all actions free, and at their own di≈øpo≈øe; yet ≈øtill under tho≈øe obligations of Gratitude, Piety and Ob≈øervance toward their Parents as their greate≈øt Benefactors, ≈øince if that they have well di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their Duty toward their Children, they can never in their whole lives ≈øufficiently recompence ≈øo great benefits as they have received from them.</p>
               <p>But it ≈øeems the Authour is not ≈øatisfied with the≈øe di≈øtinctions, <note place="margin">Ob≈øervations on <hi>Grotius</hi> de J. B. <hi>p.</hi> 62.</note> but ≈øaies, <hi>He cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how in any ca≈øe Children can ever naturally have any power or moral Faculty of doing what they plea≈øe, without their Parents leave; ≈øince they are always bound to ≈øtudy to plea≈øe them. And though by the Laws of ≈øome Nations, Children when they attain to years of di≈øcretion, have Power and Liberty in many actions, yet this Liberty is granted them by po≈øitive humane Laws only, which are made by the Supreme Fatherly Power of Princes, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate, limit, or a≈ø≈øume the Authority of Inferiour Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the publick benefit of the Commonwealth: So that naturally the Power of Parents over their Children never cea≈øeth by any ≈øeparation, but only by the permi≈ø≈øion of the tran≈øcendent Fatherly Power of the Supreme Prince, Children may be di≈øpen≈øed with, or priviledged in ≈øome ca≈øes from obedience to ≈øubordinate Parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part, I ≈øee no rea≈øon why the≈øe di≈øtinctions of <hi>Grotius</hi> may not be well enough defended again≈øt all the Rea≈øons which the Authour gives us to the contrary: For he only tells us, <hi>He cannot conceive how in any ca≈øe Children can ever naturally have any power or moral faculty of doing what they plea≈øe, without their Fathers leave; and that naturally the Power of Parents never cea≈øeth by any ≈øeparation,</hi> &amp;c. but gives us no other rea≈øon, than that they are always bound to ≈øtudy to plea≈øe them. As if this obligation of Gratitude and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50833:15"/> Complacency, did likewi≈øe comprehend a full and perfect propriety of all Fathers in the per≈øons of their Children, and an ab≈øolute power over them in all ca≈øes what≈øoever, ≈øo that Children ≈øhall have no Right left to con≈øult their own good or pre≈øervation, in any ca≈øe what≈øoever, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Bodin</hi> de Rep. l. 1. c. 4.</note> farther than the Father plea≈øes. As for <hi>Bodin,</hi> and divers others that have writ on this ≈øubject, they do no more than follow others, who have a≈ø≈øerted this Ab≈øolute Power, upon no other grounds than the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Municipal Laws; but have never troubled them≈øelves to look into the true Original of Paternal Authority, or Filial Subjection, according to the Laws of Nature or Rea≈øon. And mo≈øt Treati≈øes of this ≈øubject being commonly written by Fathers, they have been very full in ≈øetting forth their own Power and Authority over their Children; but have ≈øaid little or nothing of the Rights of Children, in the ≈øtate of Nature, towards their Parents. <note place="margin">Loc. ≈øup. laudat.</note> Therefore <hi>Bodin</hi> thinks he hath done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in ≈øuppo≈øing that if a Father is wi≈øe, and not mad, he will never kill his Son without cau≈øe, ≈øince he will never correct him without he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve it; and that therefore the Civil Law ≈øuppo≈øes, that the Will of the Parents in managing the concerns of their Children, is void of all Fraud; and that they will rather violate all Divine and Humane Laws, than not endeavour to make their Children both rich and honourable: And from tho≈øe in≈øtances out of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Law, ≈øuppo≈øes that Parents cannot ≈øo much as will any thing to their Childrens prejudice, or ≈øo much as abu≈øe this Fatherly Power of Life and Death: And therefore thinks he hath ≈øufficiently an≈øwered the Objection he makes, that there have been ≈øome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who have abu≈øed this power ≈øo far, as to put their Children to Death without cau≈øe. He ≈øays,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50833:16"/> They give us no Examples to the contrary: And ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing this to have ≈øometimes fallen out, mu≈øt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Legi≈ølators alter a whol≈øome Law, becau≈øe ≈øome per≈øons may abu≈øe it?</p>
               <p>But if we con≈øider what <hi>Bodin</hi> hath here ≈øaid, we ≈øhall finde every one of his Suppo≈øitions fal≈øe: For, 1. he ≈øuppo≈øes it to be the Right of all Fathers, by the Law of Nature, to have an ab≈øolute power over the lives and per≈øons of their Children. 2. That the Jewi≈øh and Roman Law are mo≈øt agreeable to the Laws of Nature in this point. 3. That Fathers do ≈øeldom or never abu≈øe this power. 4. That if they do abu≈øe it, yet it is better to leave it in their hands, than to abrogate it or retrench it. The fal≈øene≈øs of all which A≈ø≈øertions, I either have already, or el≈øe ≈øhall hereafter make manife≈øt: Only I ≈øhall remark thus much at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, That upon <hi>Bodin</hi>'s principle, women that murder their Ba≈øtards would have a good time on't, becau≈øe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Husbands, they have full power over the Life of their Children; and there is no rea≈øon that it ≈øhould be retrencht by any po≈øitive Laws, becau≈øe ≈øome offend again≈øt it. But however, this Argument of <hi>Bodin</hi>'s would do our Author's cau≈øe no good: for if Parents are to be tru≈øted with this ab≈øolute power over their Children, becau≈øe of the natural affection they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ≈øuppo≈øed to bear them; then Princes ought not to be tru≈øted with it, ≈øince none but Parents them≈øelves can have this natural affection towards their Children; Princes (as the Author grants) having this power onely as repre≈øenting the≈øe Parents. Whereas Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is a natural Relation, and neither can be created nor a≈ø≈øigned farther than the Civil Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have appointed; and therefore there can be no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Son by the Law of Nature, ≈øince Adoption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øes chiefly from the promi≈øe and con≈øent of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon adopted, and partly from the Authority of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50833:16"/> Civil Law, or Municipal Law of the Commonwealth. So that in relation to Princes, upon this Rea≈øon of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi>'s, <hi>ce≈ø≈øante cau≈øa, ce≈ø≈øat effectus.</hi> But indeed <hi>Bodin</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreamt of this fine Notion of our Author's, that all Monarchs were not onely Heads, but Fathers of their people, or el≈øe certainly we ≈øhould have had this as the chief Argument to prove his French Monarchy to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> But I ≈øhall trouble my ≈øelf no farther with him at pre≈øent, but ≈øhall proceed to con≈øider this point of ab≈øolute Obedience a little farther.</p>
               <p>I ≈øuppo≈øe the Author (as any ≈øober man el≈øe) would grant, that Children are not obliged ≈øo much as to attempt to perform the commands of their Parents, in ca≈øe they evidently appear impo≈ø≈øible or extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, ≈øuch as a Father may give when he is in a fit of drunkenne≈øs, madne≈øs, or ≈øudden rage, which is all one with madne≈øs; and of this who can judge, but the Children who are to perform the≈øe Commands? And in this ca≈øe no man will deny but it is lawful for the Children to hold, nay binde their mad or drunken Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in ca≈øe they cannot otherwi≈øe hinder them from doing mi≈øchief, or killing either them≈øelves, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Brethren. So that though they may do this from that natural love &amp; charity which all men in the ≈øtate of nature ought to ≈øhew toward each other, yet they may likewi≈øe ju≈øtifie the doing of it as Children, who ought to have a greater concern for the good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of their Parents, than meer ≈øtrangers, and have therefore an higher obligation to prevent their doing any mi≈øchief either to them≈øelves or neer Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; this being for the Fathers good and pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that for which he hath cau≈øe to thank them when he comes to him≈øelf. And if it be ≈øaid, that the Son may then refu≈øe his Fathers Commands, or re≈øi≈øt them, pretending he is mad, drunk, or in a rage, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is not, and thereby take occa≈øion to obey his Father
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50833:17"/> no farther than he plea≈øes: to this I an≈øwer, That the Son is either really per≈øwaded that his Father is in ≈øome of tho≈øe evil circum≈øtances before mentioned, or el≈øe onely pretends that he thinks ≈øo, when really he does not. If in the fir≈øt ca≈øe he erre in his judgment, and the ignorance did not proceed from his own fault (either of pa≈ø≈øion, prejudice, or too ≈ølight an e≈øteem of his Fathers under≈øtanding) he is not culpable, though he make ≈øuch a fal≈øe judgment of his Fathers actions: for God con≈øidering onely the ≈øincerity of the heart, does not require of any man more than he is able to perform. But if on the other ≈øide the Son play the Hypocrite, and refu≈øe his Parents Commands, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are mad or drunk, when really they are not, he is without doubt doubly guilty both, of Hypocri≈øie and Di≈øobedience. But this does not hinder Children in the ≈øtate of Nature from judging of the rea≈øonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs or lawfulne≈øs of their Parents Commands, and of the condition they are in when they gave them: for otherwi≈øe a Child ought to be of his Fathers Religion, though it were Idolatry, if he commanded it; or were obliged to break any of the Laws of Nature, if this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience were ab≈øolute. And it is a le≈ø≈øer evil that the Commands of Parents ≈øhould be di≈øobeyed, nay, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their per≈øons re≈øi≈øted, than that they ≈øhould make a Right to command or do unrea≈øonable and unlawful things in a fit of madne≈øs, drunkenne≈øs, or pa≈ø≈øion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy either them≈øelves or others.</p>
               <p>But it may be replied, that though Fathers in the ≈øtate of Nature have no Right to act unju≈øtly or cruelly toward their Children, or to command ≈øuch unlawful or unrea≈øonable things; yet however they are onely an≈øwerable to God for ≈øo doing; and there is out of a Commonwealth no ≈øuperiour power that can que≈øtion the Fathers actions: for ≈øince his Children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God to his care, he onely is an≈øwerable for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50833:17"/> them, and for his actions towards them, ≈øince no other man hath any intere≈øt or concern in them but him≈øelf. So that if he kill, maim, abu≈øe, or ≈øell his Son, there is no man that hath Right to revenge, puni≈øh, or call him to an account for ≈øo doing; and if no others that are his equals, much le≈øs his Wife and Children, who are ≈øo much his Inferiours, and who ought in all things to be obedient to his Will. Therefore this Power, though it be not ab≈øolute in re≈øpect of God, yet is ≈øo in re≈øpect of his Wife and Children: and ≈øo in all ca≈øes where the Children cannot yield an active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Fathers commands, they are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding obliged (by the Law of God; See <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 3.20.) to a pa≈ø≈øive one; and patiently to ≈øubmit to whatever evils or puni≈øhments he plea≈øes to inflict, though it were to the lo≈øs of Life it≈øelf.</p>
               <p>To which I an≈øwer, That though it is true, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ≈øtate of Nature, and con≈øidered as the head of a ≈øeparate Family, hath no Superiour but God, and con≈øequently no other per≈øon what≈øoever hath any Authority or Right to call him to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and puni≈øh him for this abu≈øe of his paternal Power; yet it doth not follow, that ≈øuch ab≈øolute ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion is therefore due from the Children, as does oblige them either to an active or a pa≈ø≈øive Obedience in all ca≈øes to the Fathers Will, ≈øo that they neither may, nor ought to defend them≈øelves in any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance what≈øoever. There is a great deal of difference (in the ≈øtate of Nature) between calling a man to an account as a Superiour, and defending a mans ≈øelf as an equal. For a man in this ≈øtate hath a right to this latter again≈øt all men that a≈ø≈øault him, by the principle of Self-pre≈øervation: But no man hath a right to the former, but onely in re≈øpect of tho≈øe over whom he hath an Authority, either granted him by God, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him by the con≈øent of other men. So
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50833:18"/> that the evils which an Aggre≈ø≈øor, or Wrong-doer, ≈øuffers from him he injured, though in re≈øpect of God the Supreme Lawgiver they may be natural Puni≈øhments ordained by him, to deter men from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Laws of Nature, yet they are not ≈øo in regard of the Per≈øon who inflicts them. For God may ≈øometimes appoint tho≈øe for the In≈øtruments of his Ju≈øtice, who otherwi≈øe do injury to the per≈øon puni≈øhed; as in the ca≈øe of <hi>Ab≈øalom</hi>'s Rebellion again≈øt his Father <hi>David.</hi> So that in this ca≈øe the evils the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer ≈øuffers are not properly Puni≈øhments, but nece≈ø≈øary Con≈øequences of his Violence and Inju≈øtice; and in re≈øpect of the Inflicter, are but nece≈ø≈øary means of his pre≈øervation. So that if a Son have any Right to defend him≈øelf in what belongs to him from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øt violence of his Father, he doth not act as his Superiour; but in this ca≈øe as his Equal, as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all the Rights of Nature, con≈øidered only as a Man; Such as are a Right to live, and to pre≈øerve him≈øelf, and to u≈øe all lawful means for that end. Therefore ≈øince, as I have already ≈øhown, that a Father hath no higher Right or Authority from God over the per≈øon of his Child, but as it tends to his good and pre≈øervation, or as it conduces to the great end of Nature, the common Good and pre≈øervation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: So when the Father tran≈øgre≈ø≈øes this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, his Right cea≈øes; and when that cea≈øes, the Sons Right to pre≈øerve him≈øelf (and in that, to pur≈øue that great end) begins to take place. Therefore out of a Civil ≈øtate, if a Father will endeavour evidently, without any ju≈øt cau≈øe, to take away his Sons Life, I think the Son may in this ca≈øe, if he cannot otherwi≈øe e≈øcape nor avoid it, and that his Father will not be pacified nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion nor entreaty, defend him≈øelf again≈øt his Father, not with a de≈øign to kill him, but purely to pre≈øerve his own Life; and if in this ca≈øe the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50833:18"/> Father happen to be kill'd, I think his Blood is upon his own head. But if any object to me the Example of <hi>I≈øaac</hi>'s ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to his Father, when he intended to ≈øacri≈øice him: To this I an≈øwer, that as this act of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s is not to be taken as an Example for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers, ≈øo neither does the Example of <hi>I≈øaac</hi> oblige other Sons. For as <hi>Abraham</hi> had no right to offer up his Son, but by God's expre≈øs Will; ≈øo it is rational to ≈øuppo≈øe, that <hi>I≈øaac</hi> being then (as Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers make him) about nineteen or twenty years of Age, and able to carry wood enough upon his back to con≈øume the Sacrifice, and of years to ask where the Lamb was for the Offering; was al≈øo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed by his Father of the cau≈øe of his dealing ≈øo with him: and then the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion was not paid to his Father's, but to God's Will, whom he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded would have it ≈øo. But if any man yet doubts, whether re≈øi≈øtance in ≈øuch a ca≈øe were lawful, I leave it to his own Con≈øcience, whether if his Father and he were out of any civil e≈øtate, who≈øe a≈ø≈øi≈øtance he might implore, he would lie ≈øtill, and ≈øuffer his Father to cut his throat, only becau≈øe he had a minde to it, or pretended revelation for it.</p>
               <p>So likewi≈øe if a Father in this ≈øtate ≈øhould go about to violate his Sons Wife in his pre≈øence, or to kill her, or his Grandchildren, I ≈øuppo≈øe he may as lawfully u≈øe the ≈øame means for their pre≈øervation, (if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwi≈øe obtain it) as he might for his own; ≈øince they are delivered to his charge, and that he only is an≈øwerable for them. For ≈øince the Father doth not acquire any property in the Sons per≈øon, either by begetting or educating him, much le≈øs ought he to have it over tho≈øe the Son hath begotten.</p>
               <p>But though Children may have this Right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their own Lives, or tho≈øe of their Wives and Children, from their Fathers unju≈øt violence, when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50833:19"/> they can by no means el≈øe be pre≈øerved; Yet I would not be here under≈øtood to give Children this right of re≈øi≈øting upon any le≈øs occa≈øion; as if the Father ≈øhould only go about to correct his Son, though without ju≈øt cau≈øe, it were therefore lawful for him to re≈øi≈øt or beat his Father. For we are obliged by the Law of Chri≈øt to bear ≈ømaller Injuries from others, much more from a Father; neither yet would I give them any right to continue this ≈øtate of War, and to revenge upon their Parents the Injuries they have formerly received at their hands. For all Revenge, taken in this ≈øence, as a ≈øatisfaction of the minde in returning of an evil or injury already received, without any re≈øpect to a mans own pre≈øervation, or the good of the per≈øon that did the wrong, is unlawful even in the ≈øtate of Nature. Therefore this returning Evil for Evil, which ≈øome improperly call Revenge, is only ju≈øtifiable for one or both of the≈øe ends; either to make the party that hath done the Injury ≈øen≈øible of his Errour, and ≈øeeing the Follies and Inconveniences of it, to alter his minde, and re≈øolve to do ≈øo no more; or as it may conduce to a mans own pre≈øervation for the future, and be a warning to others not to injure him in like manner, ≈øince they ≈øee he will not take injuries tamely. But all this is ≈øtill left to a mans own prudence, how far he will pa≈øs them by: And he is certainly obliged to leave off returning them, a≈ø≈øoon as he can be ≈øafe without it; ≈øince otherwi≈øe quarrels would be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Neither ought one, who hath been highly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to a man perhaps for his life, to return him evil for evil, ≈øince ≈øcarce any Injury being great enough to cancel ≈øo great an Obligation. Therefore ≈øince a Father, who hath truely performed his Duty, is the greate≈øt Benefactor we can imagine in this life; ≈øo no man ought to revenge an Injury, though never ≈øo great, upon him; ≈øince it is not only undutiful, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50833:19"/> ungrateful, and cannot ≈øerve either of tho≈øe two ends for which alone this returning evil for evil is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For fir≈øt, it cannot make the Father ≈øee his fault; ≈øince this correction being from a Son whom he looks upon as one highly obliged to him, and ≈øo much his inferior, will rather ≈øerve to exa≈øperate than amend him. Secondly, Neither can this bearing of the Injury encourage others to attempt doing the like; ≈øince all that know the ca≈øe, will likewi≈øe con≈øider the per≈øon that did the wrong. So that Patience alone is the only lawful means to make the Father ≈øee his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and be reconciled to his Child, who ought to embrace it a≈ø≈øoon as the Father offers it.</p>
               <p>But as for the places of Scripture brought for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute Obedience to Parents; <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, obey your Parents in the Lord,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 6.1,2. and <hi>Children, obey your Parents in all things,</hi> Col. 3.20. God did not intend here to give us any new Law or Precept concerning this Duty, but to confirm and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the fifth Commandment; as that was but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Law of Nature, by which men were obliged to reverence and obey their Parents, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Law was given. Therefore ≈øince the Laws of Nature (which are but Rules of right Rea≈øon for the good of Mankinde) are the foundation of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and of all tho≈øe commands in the New Te≈øtament, they are ≈øtill to be interpreted according to that Rule. Neither are other places of Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood in any other ≈øence; ≈øuch as are tho≈øe of turning the right Cheek, of giving away a mans Coat to him that would go to Law, and the like: all which we are not to Interpret Literally, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Grotius <hi>and. Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's <hi>Annot. upon the≈øe places.</hi>
                  </note> but according to Rea≈øon. And ≈øo are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe the≈øe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood, <hi>Children, obey your Parents in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50833:20"/> all things;</hi> that is, in all things rea≈øonable and lawful. And this ≈øence mu≈øt be allowed of, or el≈øe Children were bound to obey all commands of their Parents, whether unlawful or lawful; being comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this general word <hi>All.</hi> Nor will the di≈øtinction of an active or pa≈ø≈øive Obedience help in this ca≈øe; for pa≈ø≈øive Obedience cannot be the end of the Fathers command, and con≈øequently his will is not performed in ≈øuffering; ≈øince no Father can be ≈øo unrea≈øonably cruel, as to command a thing meerly becau≈øe he would have occa≈øion to puni≈øh his Son whom he thinks mu≈øt not re≈øi≈øt him. Neither do the≈øe places appoint a Son when an infant, a man of full age, and perhaps an old man of three≈øcore, to be all governed the ≈øame way, or that the ≈øame Obedience is required of them all.</p>
               <p>And this brings me to a fuller An≈øwer to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Argument, and to ≈øhew that though Children are indeed always bound in Gratitude to plea≈øe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (as far as they are able without ruining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves) and to pay a great reverence to them; yet that this ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion is not an ab≈øolute ≈øubjection, but is to be limited according to the Rules of right Rea≈øon or Prudence. And to prove this, I will produce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances from the ca≈øe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children, ≈øince the Author allows no Father to have had a larger autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than him≈øelf: We will therefore con≈øider in the fir≈øt place, <hi>Adam</hi>'s power as a Father, in re≈øpect of his Sons marriage. Suppo≈øe then that he had commanded one of his Sons never to marry at all, certainly this command would have been yoid, ≈øince then it had been in <hi>Adam</hi>'s power to have fru≈øtrated Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to mankind of increa≈øe and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleni≈øh the Earth; which was not ≈øpoken to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> alone, ≈øince they could not do it in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, but to all mankind repre≈øented in them. And likewi≈øe <hi>Adam</hi> had been the occa≈øion of his Sons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50833:20"/> if he had lain with any of his Si≈øters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppo≈øe <hi>Adam</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abel</hi> to marry one of his Si≈øters (that being the onely means then appointed to propagate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) which he could not love, can any man think that he had been obliged to do it? Certainly no: for it would have been a greater ≈øin to marry a wife he knew before-hand he could not live with, than to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey his Father; for el≈øe how could this be true, <hi>Therefore ≈øhall a man leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife?</hi> Since then <hi>Adam</hi> could not force his Sons affections, but onely recommend ≈øuch of his Si≈øters as he thought would be≈øt ≈øuit with his humour, therefore if the Son could not live without marriage, and that <hi>Adam</hi> could not force a Wife upon him, it was mo≈øt rea≈øonable that he ≈øhould chu≈øe a Wife for him≈øelf. And to come to that other great point, that the Son can never ≈øeparate him≈øelf from his Fathers Family nor ≈øubjection, as his Lord and Ma≈øter, without his con≈øent: Suppo≈øe then that <hi>Adam</hi> had been ≈øo cruel and unnatural (as ≈øome Fathers are) and being ≈øen≈øible of the profit he received from his Sons labours, would never have given them leave to have left his Family, and have ≈øet up for them≈øelves, nor to have had any thing of their own, but (onely allowing them and their Wives a bare ≈øub≈øi≈øtance) have kept them like ≈ølaves as long as they lived; the Author I ≈øuppo≈øe would reply, That he might have done ≈øo if he had plea≈øed; and that the Sons had no lawful means to help them≈øelves, ≈øince he onely was Judge when or whether ever it was fit to ≈øet them free or no.</p>
               <p>But I de≈øire to know whether <hi>Adam</hi> had this power by a natural Right, or an acquired; not by the latter: for I have already proved, that neither Generation nor Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion can confer an ab≈øolute Right over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50833:21"/> of another: Nor yet could he have it by the Sons con≈øent; for they would never give their con≈øent to ≈øuch an ab≈øolute ≈ølavi≈øh ≈øubjection. Nor yet could he have any ≈øuch Right by the revealed Will of God, ≈øince I have al≈øo proved that ≈øuch an ab≈øolute ≈øubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nowhere requir'd by him in Scripture.</p>
               <p>But now to return to the acquired Right of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither can that confer ≈øo ab≈øolute a power over any mans per≈øon, as that therefore he ≈øhould be a ≈ølave to his Fo≈øterer as long as he liv'd; ≈øince admitting that the Father, or other per≈øon that takes upon him that care, may perhaps ju≈øtly claim a Right in the ≈øervice or labour of the Childe, to ≈øatisfie them for their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charge in bringing him up: Yet it does not therefore follow, that this ≈øervice is due as long as the Childe lives, but rather until ≈øuch time as they can make his labour ≈øatisfie them for their charge and trouble in keeping him; which may very well be by that time the Child attains to twenty five years of age at farthe≈øt. And there are tho≈øe that have offered to breed up and maintain all the Foundlings and Ba≈øtard-children in <hi>England,</hi> if they may be bound to ≈øerve them until about that age. So that I ≈øee no rea≈øon why a few years Education ≈øhould give any man a Right over another per≈øon as long as he lived. But if it be urged that the Childe owed his life to his Father or Fo≈øterer, ≈øince without his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance he mu≈øt have peri≈øht, and therefore the ≈øervice of the Childs whole life is but little enough to recompence it; to this I an≈øwer, That the Parents are under an ab≈øolute obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, by the Laws of God and Nature, to breed up their Childe; and they ≈øin if they do not perform it as they ought: the end of a Father not being chiefly for the breeding up and pre≈øervation of the Child, and therefore there is no rea≈øon he ≈øhould acquire ≈øuch a property in him, meerly becau≈øe he did his duty; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50833:21"/> the intent of a Father being to better the condition of his Son, and not to make it wor≈øe, I doubt whether an ab≈øolute or perpetual Servitude, or Death it ≈øelf, were the better bargain; and if this Right will not hold for the Father him≈øelf, much le≈øs will it for a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterer, ≈øince he is likewi≈øe obliged by the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Humanity, if he be able, to breed up the Child he finds, and not to let it peri≈øh. So that the advantage he may make of the Child ought not to be the principal end of his undertaking, but the doing of good to mankind; and the advantage is to be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered onely as an encouragement, not as the onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his duty, ≈øince he is obliged to do the ≈øame thing, though he were ≈øure the Childe would either die or be taken away from him, before it could be with him half long enough to ≈øatisfie him. Neither does this rea≈øon hold true, according to the Scripture-rules of Gratitude, that a man hath Right to exact of one to whom he hath done a Courte≈øie, or be≈øtowed a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, a Return as great as the Benefit be≈øtowed; ≈øince this were not beneficence, but meer bartering or exchange: And a man who had his life ≈øaved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a≈ø≈øi≈øtance (≈øuppo≈øe by pulling him out of the water) was obliged by this principle to leave his life at his di≈øpo≈øal ever after.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ≈øee no rea≈øon, from all that hath yet been ≈øaid, why a Son when he comes to be a man able to ≈øhift for him≈øelf, may not in the ≈øtate of nature marry, and ≈øeparate him≈øelf from his fathers Family, even without his Fathers con≈øent, if he cannot otherwi≈øe obtain his liberty by his entreaty and all fair means: Not but that the Father may, if he plea≈øe, di≈øinherit his Son for ≈øo doing, or for marrying without his con≈øent, ≈øince every man is free to di≈øpo≈øe of his own upon what conditions he thinks fit. And the Son was to have con≈øidered before-hand which he valued mo≈øt, his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50833:22"/> own Liberty, or his Fathers kindne≈øs, and the hopes of his ≈øhare of his E≈øtate after his death.</p>
               <p>But I now come to the Author's main Argument from Scripture-Examples: <hi>That the Patriarchs, by a Right derived from</hi> Adam, <hi>did exerci≈øe as Heads of their re≈øpective Families, a dominion as ab≈øolute as that of any Monarch: And ≈øo in≈øtances in</hi> Thamar <hi>brought out to be burnt by her Father-in-law</hi> Judah: <hi>Touching War,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram<hi>'s commanding an Army of</hi> 318 <hi>Souldiers of his own Family;</hi> E≈øau<hi>'s meeting his Brother with</hi> 400 <hi>men at Arms: For matter of Peace,</hi> Abram<hi>'s making a League with</hi> Abimelech: <hi>And that the≈øe acts of judging in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Crimes, of making War and Peace, are the chiefe≈øt marks of Soveraignty that are found in a Monarchy.</hi> All which I ≈øhall endeavour to an≈øwer. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The in≈øtance of <hi>Judah</hi> rather makes again≈øt him; for he confines this power before to the chief Father of the Family, and will never have Children to be free from ≈øubjection to their Fathers: whereas in this ca≈øe <hi>Judah,</hi> as Head of his own Family, exerci≈øed an ab≈øolute power of Life and Death, and ≈øo was free from ≈øubjection to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was then living. And ≈øuppo≈øe (as the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. expre≈ø≈øes) <hi>Judah</hi> went down from his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to a certain <hi>Adullamite,</hi> and there married, and ≈øet up a di≈øtinct Family; yet this will not help the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ≈øince (<hi>p.</hi> 33.) he will not allow the Fatherly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be confined to one Family, if the Families were at ≈øuch a di≈øtance as they might receive their fathers commands; which lies upon him to prove: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ≈øubjection was not perpetual. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ≈øhall ≈øhew by another Example, that the Head of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily hath not ab≈øolute power of the lives of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Grandchildren; and that is from <hi>Reuben</hi>'s pathetical Speech, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he refu≈øed to ≈øend <hi>Benjamin</hi> with him into <hi>Egypt; Slay my two ≈øons</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>if I bring him not unto thee.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50833:22"/> Now if <hi>Jacob</hi> had this ab≈øolute power as a Father, it had been impertinent in <hi>Reuben</hi> to have ≈øpoke thus, ≈øince he knew his Father had power to ≈ølay his Sons, if he thought fit, whether he gave him ≈øuch an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or not. But if it be replied, that <hi>Jacob</hi> when his Sons married might ≈øet them at liberty, and ≈øo give them power of Life and Death; that is, make them ab≈øolute in their re≈øpective Families: This is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and no proof brought of it out of Scripture, and therefore may as well be otherwi≈øe: Nor is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øhould thus manumit his Sons, ≈øince it is apparent they did not then ≈øet up di≈øtinct Families; for we finde <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øtill commanding them, as Head of the Family, to go down and buy Corn in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ≈øaying, <hi>Go down and buy us</hi> (that is, the whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereof they were Members) <hi>a little food.</hi> And yet the≈øe Sons did not think their Fathers command ≈øo ab≈øolute, but that they tell him plainly, they will not go down unle≈øs he ≈øend <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>As for the other Examples of <hi>Abram</hi>'s exerci≈øing the full power of a Prince in making War and Peace, I will not deny that the Heads of ≈øeparate Families, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Commonwealths, have many things analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to them, though they are not Commonwealths them≈øelves: And the rea≈øon why I do not allow them to be ≈øo, is, becau≈øe the ends of a Family and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth are divers: and ≈øo many parts of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Empire are not to be found in Families, yet the Heads of ≈øuch Families may notwith≈øtanding exerci≈øe a power of Life and Death in great Offences, and al≈øo of making War and Peace: And this being for the good of the Family they govern, and by their implyed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents, no body will contradict him in the exerci≈øe of this power. But this being matter of fact, does not prove an ab≈øolute and unque≈øtionable Right in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ≈øuch a Family, of doing what≈øoever he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50833:23"/> plea≈øe, and that no Member of the Family hath power in any ca≈øe to contradict his will; for it is rational to conceive that this Father of a Family having had an authority over his Children and Servants (born per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in his hou≈øe) from their very Infancy, and if he be a wi≈øe and a good man, and hath carried him≈øelf as a good Father or Ma≈øter ought to do toward them, ≈øhould even by their con≈øents (as knowing none more worthy than him≈øelf) retain the exerci≈øe of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority after they are gown up to be men; in which he cannot be contradicted, without di≈øorder and mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the whole Family: So that indeed this ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of the Children and Servants, is by a tacite con≈øent to obey the Father or Ma≈øter in all things ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common good of the Family. But this proves not this ab≈øolute de≈øpotick power the Author contends for, but onely the mo≈øt rea≈øonable way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting for the Families good, and whil≈øt the Father exerci≈øes this Authority onely for that end, which when he tran≈øgre≈ø≈øes, his Right to govern cea≈øes: for if this Author would have but con≈øidered the ≈øtate of ≈øome parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> he ≈øhould have found, that where the Father will exerci≈øe this ab≈øolute power, and ≈øell his Children for ≈ølaves, the Children make as little ≈øcruple (where they are ≈øtrong enough) to put the ≈øame trick upon their Fathers: Nor can they be ju≈øtly blamed for ≈øo doing, until any man can ≈øhew me that the Father hath ≈øome better Right than meer Cu≈øtom or Power.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall now proceed to the con≈øideration of tho≈øe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places he produces out of Scripture, for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right of Fathers to be Kings over their De≈øcendants. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> p. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> As for the example of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him; for here the Grand≈øon of <hi>Ham,</hi> who ought to have been a Servant to the Children of <hi>Shem</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50833:23"/> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> interrupting this Paternal Empire, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers and tyrannizes not onely over his own Family, but the De≈øcendants of the elder Brethren. But Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> (of which opinion the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf is) will have him to be Lord over his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, by Right of Succe≈ø≈øion; but to enlarge his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire again≈øt Right, by ≈øeizing violently on the Rights of other Lords of Families.</p>
               <p>But however, after the confu≈øion of Tongues, the Author will have it revive again; and <hi>the di≈øtinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereupon erected, were not confu≈øed Multitudes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heads or Governours, and at liberty to chu≈øe what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours they plea≈øed; but they were di≈øtinct Families which had Fathers for Rulers over them: whereby it plainly appears, that even in this confu≈øion God was careful to pre≈øerve the Fatherly Authority, by di≈øtributing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øity of Languages according to the diver≈øity of Families.</hi> For ≈øo it appears by the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.5.20.22.</p>
               <p>But the≈øe places will not prove what the Author quotes them for, <hi>viz.</hi> the Monarchical or Kingly power of Fathers: for neither does the Scripture or <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> mention, that this divi≈øion of the World by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Po≈øterity was performed by the Fathers of the≈øe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as ab≈øolute Monarchs; but it rather ≈øeems that their Children and De≈øcendants followed them as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, as retaining a Reverence and Affection to their per≈øons for their great age, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and care of their Families: Which <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Will. Temple</hi>'s E≈ø≈øay of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>p.</hi> 67.</note> an ingenious modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor conceives to be the natural ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all Governments, ≈øpringing from a tacite defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Authority of one ≈øingle per≈øon. And of this opinion is excellent <hi>Pufendorf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of this kind were tho≈øe fir≈øt Kings which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtotle</hi> calls Heroical, <hi>whom the People did obey of their own accord, becau≈øe they de≈øerved well of them, and either
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50833:24"/> by teaching them Arts, or by warring for them, or by gathering them together when they were di≈øper≈øed, or by dividing Lands among them. Secondly,</hi> If it were true that the≈øe Fathers of Families were ≈øo many ab≈øolute Kings, yet it quite de≈øtroys the Author's <hi>Hypothe≈øis,</hi> who will have but one true Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> who if he could be known, had a natural Right to be Monarch of the whole world. <hi>And though Kings now</hi> (Patriarch. p. 19.) <hi>are not the natural Parents of their Subjects, yet they all either are, or are to be reputed Heirs to tho≈øe fir≈øt Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who were at fir≈øt natural Parents of the People, and in their right ≈øucceed to the exerci≈øe of Supreme Juri≈ødiction; and ≈øuch Heirs are not only Lords of their own Children, but al≈øo of their Brethren, and all others that were ≈øubject to their Fathers.</hi> Whereas we ≈øee here no ≈øuch right of Elder≈øhip ob≈øerved, neither among the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> nor their de≈øcendants; but every one, as appears from the words of the Text, was an independant Head &amp; Leader of his own Family: by the≈øe were the I≈øles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles divided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by the≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> the de≈øcendants of <hi>Shem,</hi> were the Nations divided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So likewi≈øe the other places he brings concerning the Sons of <hi>I≈øhmael</hi> and <hi>E≈øau,</hi> do de≈øtroy the Authours notion of an Heir to the Authority of the Father, or that any Son is more Lord of his Brethren than another. For all the Sons of <hi>E≈øau</hi> and <hi>I≈øhmael</hi> are reckon'd as ≈øo many inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Princes, or Dukes, and Lords of di≈øtinct Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, without any Superiority in the elde≈øt Son, who ought by the Authours Principle to have been ab≈øolute Lord over the re≈øt: And if the≈øe could divide them≈øelves into as many di≈øtinct Governments as there were Sons, Why might not they do ≈øo <hi>in infinitum?</hi> And then there could never be any common Prince or Monarch ≈øet over them all, but by Force or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt, or el≈øe by Election; either of which de≈øtroys the notion of the Natural Right of Elder≈øhip. And
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50833:24"/> as for the places he brings to prove it; 1. Gods words to <hi>Gain</hi> concerning <hi>Abel,</hi> will not do it, <hi>His de≈øires ≈øhall be ≈øubject unto thee, and thou ≈øhalt rule over him.</hi> For fir≈øt, this might be ≈øpoken only per≈øonally to <hi>Cain,</hi> and not to give a Right to all Elde≈øt Sons. Secondly, the words do not ≈øignifie an ab≈øolute De≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Power, but a ruling or governing by per≈øwa≈øion or fair means; as when a man is ruled, that is, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øed by another in his concerns. Then as for the ble≈ø≈øing upon <hi>Jacob</hi> by his Father <hi>I≈øaac, Be Lord over thy Brethren, and let the Sons of thy Mother bow before thee,</hi> 'twas never litterally fulfilled. For <hi>Jacob</hi> was never Lord over <hi>E≈øau,</hi> who was a Prince of Mount <hi>Seir</hi> in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s life-time, whil≈øt <hi>Jacob</hi> was at be≈øt but Lord of his own family. And as for bowing and other Rights of Superiority, we read [<hi>Gen.</hi> 33.3.] that <hi>Jacob,</hi> at his Interview with his Brother <hi>E≈øau,</hi> called him Lord, and bowed ≈øeven times to the ground before he came to him. So that this Text is no more than a Prophecy, to ≈øhew why the Jews, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcendents of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ≈øhould have Right in After-times to rule over the <hi>Edomites,</hi> or Po≈øterity of <hi>E≈øau.</hi> La≈øtly, this Example makes again≈øt the Authour: for it ≈øeems it is not the Elde≈øt Son, but whom the Father plea≈øes to appoint, is Heir after his death: Since here <hi>E≈øau</hi> loo≈øes his Birth right by his own act, but chiefly by his Fathers Will.</p>
               <p>Yet if after all, ≈øome will urge from the Principles I have laid down, that it ≈øeems more to conduce to the happine≈øs and peace of Families, and in that to the great end I have before laid down, the common good of Mankinde, rather to allow this ab≈øolute Power of Life and Death to Parents over their Children, and an ab≈øolute Subjection to them as long as they live; ≈øince Parents do u≈øually take that care to breed up their Children, and to have that tender Affection towards
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50833:25"/> them, that they will ≈øeldom take away their Lives, or ≈øell them for Slaves, or keep them ≈øo them≈øelves, unle≈øs there be very great cau≈øe; of which the Father only ought to be Judge, ≈øince it being the nature of mo≈øt Children to be apt to contradict and di≈øobey their Fathers commands, or perhaps re≈øi≈øt them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending they would kill them, when they only go about to give them due correction; And ≈øince mo≈øt young people hate re≈øtraint, and love to be gadding abroad, they having a Right by the≈øe Principles to judge when they are able to ≈øhift for them≈øelves, would take any ≈ølight pretence to run away from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a≈ø≈øoon as they were grown pretty big, and ≈øo perhaps leave their Parents in their old Age, when they had no body to take care of them: whereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confu≈øion and quarrels would happen in Families, great mi≈øchief to the Parents, and often ruine to the Children; who being often opiniatred, and ≈øelf-will'd, would think better of their own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities than they really de≈øerved. And therefore divers Nations ≈øeeing the≈øe great Inconveniencies, did by their Laws leave Parents the Power of Life and Death over their Children. <hi>Such were</hi> (tho≈øe the Author in≈øtances in) <hi>the</hi> Per≈øians, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Patriarcha,</hi> p. 38. chap. 2.</note> Gauls, <hi>and many Nations in the</hi> We≈øt-Indies: <hi>And the</hi> Romans <hi>even in their Popular State had this Law in force: Which Power of Parents was ratified and amplified by the Laws of the</hi> XII Tables, <hi>enabling of Parents to ≈øell their Children three times. And the Law of</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>gives full power to the Father to ≈øtone his di≈øobedient Son, ≈øo it be done in pre≈øence of a Magi≈øtrate. And yet it did not belong to the Magi≈øtrate to inquire and examine the ju≈øtne≈øs of the cau≈øe; but it was ≈øo ordained, le≈øt the Father ≈øhould in his Anger ≈øuddenly or ≈øecretly kill his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I an≈øwer, that ≈øince this Argument
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50833:25"/> quits the natural Power of a Father by Generation, and only ≈øticks to the acquired one of education, and appeals to the common good of Mankinde; I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it is a better than any of the re≈øt. Yet I think it is not true, that Parents in the ≈øtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would more ≈øeldome abu≈øe their power, than Children would this Natural Liberty I here allow them, of defending and providing for them≈øelves in ca≈øes of extreme Danger and Nece≈ø≈øity. For this Temptation to do ill is greater on the Fathers ≈øide, than that of the Children: For they looking on them≈øelves as having an ab≈øolute and unque≈øtionable power over them, and that they may deal with them as they plea≈øe, are apt to think them≈øelves ≈ølighted and di≈øobeyed by their Children, perhaps on very light occa≈øions; and their Pa≈ø≈øion often ri≈øes to that height (as not con≈øidering the Follies and Incon≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratene≈øs of Youth) that they may, if Cholerick or Ill-natur'd, ≈øtrike them with that which may either kill them, or el≈øe cripple or maim them; and perhaps out of an immoderate Anger, or being weary of them, murder them on purpo≈øe. And Fathers being more apt, as having oftner occa≈øion to be angry with their Children, than their Children with them, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to me, that in the ≈øtate of Nature (where there is no Magi≈øtrate to keep the Father in awe) Fathers will be as apt to kill or maim their Children, as Children their Parents. And if the Fathers (as I ≈øaid before) are intended for the good and pre≈øervation of their Child; and that where their Right cea≈øes, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Right to pre≈øerve them≈øelves takes place: It ≈øeems to conduce more to the general good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, that the Children ≈øhould make u≈øe of this la≈øt refuge of defending them≈øelves, when they cannot otherwi≈øe pre≈øerve their Lives and Members, than that Fathers ≈øhould have ≈øuch an ab≈øolute Right to deal
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50833:26"/> with them as they plea≈øed, without any power in the Children to re≈øi≈øt or defend them≈øelves. So likewi≈øe Fathers being ≈øo much older, under≈øtand their own advantage better than their Children; and being ≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ill-natur'd, and often (by rea≈øon of their Age) more covetous than they, may be tempted to ≈øell their Children for Slaves, whereby they may fall into a condition wor≈øe than Death it≈øelf; and may not the Son then endeavour to run away, or u≈øe all lawful means po≈ø≈øible to e≈øcape ≈øo great a mi≈øery? Or if the Father will keep his Son as a Slave all the days of his life, without any hopes of ever being free? For when the Father dies, the Son (according to this Authour) is to be Servant to his Elde≈øt Brother, or to whomever el≈øe his Father plea≈øed to bequeath him. Is not the ca≈øe the ≈øame? And as for the quiet of the Family, which is ≈øuppo≈øed to be pre≈øerved by the Sons ab≈øolute ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, rather than his re≈øi≈øtance in any circum≈øtance, I think it would rather increa≈øe Di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by encouraging of Fathers to u≈øe their Power over their Children, not as Rea≈øon, but Drunkenne≈øs or Pa≈ø≈øion may impel them: Whereas this Right of Children in defending their Lives, and not being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to give them up at their Fathers plea≈øure, will rather make Parents act moderately and di≈øcreetly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Children, when they know they are not obliged to ≈øtay or bear with them upon other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than that they may enjoy their Lives in ≈øafety, and the ordinary means thereof with ≈øome comfort. Not that I give Children any Right, as I ≈øaid before, to di≈øobey their Parents, or re≈øi≈øt them upon every ≈ølight occa≈øion; but rather to bear with their Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as far as it is po≈ø≈øible; And to ≈øuffer divers Hard≈øhips and Inconveniencies from them, rather than to re≈øi≈øt or leave them; con≈øidering the great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they owe them. So that I do not allow this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50833:26"/> Remedy, but in ca≈øe of extreme Nece≈ø≈øity, yet of which the Sufferer only in the ≈øtate of Nature can be Judge; ≈øince in that ≈øtate where there is no Umpire, (without both their con≈øents) but God only, every man is Judge when his Life is in danger.</p>
               <p>And if the Peace of Mankinde were to be procured merely by a mans Sufferance and Submi≈ø≈øion, without any re≈øpect to this Right, then it would be his duty to give him≈øelf up to be robb'd or kill'd by any one who had the wickedne≈øs to attempt it; becau≈øe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf being innocent, may go to Heaven; and the other being guilty of an intent to rob or murder, may be damned if he be killed. And be≈øides, it would more conduce to the pre≈øervation of Mankinde, that but one man ≈øhould be lo≈øt, whereas by re≈øi≈øtance they may both peri≈øh. Yet I ≈øuppo≈øe no man is ≈øo ≈øotti≈øh, as to hold he ought quit his own pre≈øervation in the≈øe ca≈øes; or if he do hold it for di≈øcour≈øe ≈øake, I am ≈øure he would not be ≈øo mad as to ob≈øerve it. For this were ≈øuch an Argument, as to hold, Becau≈øe ≈øome men may abu≈øe that Law of Self-pre≈øervation to another mans de≈øtruction; Therefore it were unlawful to defend a mans ≈øelf at all.</p>
               <p>As for the Examples of tho≈øe Nations and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths who have permitted Fathers to exerci≈øe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpotick Power over their Children; The Law of Nature or right Rea≈øon, is not to be gathered from the Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Laws or Cu≈øtoms of any particular Nation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which are often different and contrary to each other. Therefore as to the Jewi≈øh Law, though I will not ≈øay it was contrary to the Law of Nature, yet it was extremely rigorous and ≈øevere in all its di≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øations, and does not now oblige Chri≈øtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths in this particular, as in divers others, much le≈øs in the ≈øtate of Nature. And as for the <hi>Romans,</hi> they ≈øaw the inconveniencies of this Ab≈øolute Power,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50833:27"/> and retrenched it by degrees, until it came to be no more than now with us, and in mo≈øt Countreys of <hi>Europe.</hi> So likewi≈øe the Arguments which <hi>Bodin</hi> brings for the ab≈øolute power of Parents over their Children, depending upon the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Law, may be ea≈øily an≈øwered from the≈øe grounds.</p>
               <p>Having, as I hope, clear'd this main point of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Authority, and of Natural Obedience, without giving an extravagant power to Parents on the one hand to abu≈øe their power, or a priviledge to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on the other ≈øide to be ≈øtubborn or di≈øobedient to their Parents; If then this Paternal Authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend farther than I have ≈øeated it, I ≈øhall own my ≈øelf beholding to any Friend of the Authour's, or his Opinions, to ≈øhew me my errour. But if they cannot, I de≈øire they would con≈øider, whether this natural Right of Kings which the Authour a≈ø≈øerts precedent to any compact or civil con≈øtitution, can extend farther than the natural Authority of Fathers, from whom they are ≈øuppo≈øed to derive it, and on which it is founded. And if it appears that Princes have ≈øuch Power as our Fathers, then all that the Authour hath writ on this ≈øubject ≈øignifies ju≈øt nothing.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ≈øhall now proceed to examine the re≈øt of his Principles; and ≈øhall I hope prove, that (≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing this Fatherly Power as ab≈øolute as the Authour fancies) yet that his Divine Ab≈øolute Monarchy cannot however be derived from thence.</p>
               <p>The Authour ≈øeems to think it a Que≈øtion very ea≈øie to be an≈øwered. If any one asks what comes of this Right of Fatherhood, in ca≈øe the Crown, Fatherly power, e≈øcheat for want of an Heir, whether it fall to the People, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Patriarch.</hi> P. 20.</note> or what el≈øe becomes of it? To which his An≈øwer is, <hi>That it is but the Negligence or Ignorance of the People to loo≈øe the knowledg of the true Heir; for an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50833:27"/> Heir there is always. If</hi> Adam <hi>were ≈øtill living, and now were ready to die, it is certain that there is but one Man, and but one in the world, who is next Heir; although the knowledge who ≈øhould be that one Man be quite lo≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this fine Notion ≈øignifies nothing now, for <hi>Adam</hi> being dead, and his right Heir not to be known, it is all one as if he had none; ≈øince, for ought I know to the contrary, the Authors Footman may be the Man. But to help this, the Author hath found out a couple of Expedients, (≈øuch as they be;) The fir≈øt is, <note place="margin">Directions for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>p.</hi> 69.</note> 
                  <hi>That an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper of this Power, where the knowledge of the right Heir is lo≈øt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in by po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, is to be taken and reputed for the true Heir, and is to be obeyed by them as their Father.</hi> And if this will not do, he gives us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and tells us, <note place="margin">Patriarch. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>The Government in this ca≈øe is not devolved upon the multitude; but the Kingly power e≈øcheats in ≈øuch ca≈øes to the Fathers and independent Heads of Families: For every Kingdom is re≈øolved into tho≈øe parts of which it was fir≈øt made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each of which we will examine in their turn. To begin with the former, let us ≈øee if it be ≈øo ea≈øie a thing as the Authour makes it, to know who was <hi>Adam</hi>'s, or any Monarch's right Heir (≈øetting the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Laws of the Country a≈øide;) ≈øo that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot be excu≈øed of wilful Ignorance or Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, if they loo≈øe this knowledg. Where by the way I ob≈øerve, that as ea≈øie a thing as it was to know who was <hi>Adam</hi>'s right Heir, and upon whom by the Laws of God and Nature the Crown is to de≈øcend, upon the Death of the Monarch; yet he no where po≈øitively an≈øwers this important Que≈øtion: For ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is to claim by de≈øcent, as in this in≈øtance of the Heir of <hi>Adam;</hi> ≈øometimes by his Father's la≈øt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50833:28"/> Will, as in the ca≈øe of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons, according as the Examples out of Scripture do be≈øt ≈øerve his turn. So that I believe he did not either negligently or ignorantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ≈øettling this point, becau≈øe he might ≈øtill have a hole left to creep out at, or el≈øe becau≈øe he could do it no better than the In≈øtances he brings would permit.</p>
               <p>He ≈øays, [Direct. for Obedience, <hi>pag.</hi> 68.] <hi>A Son is always to live under the ≈øubjection of his Father, unle≈øs by Gods immediate appointment, or by the Grant or Death of his Father, he become him≈øelf po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of that Power to which he was ≈øubject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which words he ≈øeems to imply, that this Power is to de≈øcend to the Elde≈øt Son, when his Father dies. So likewi≈øe in this Treati≈øe we are now upon, [<hi>P.</hi> 12.] he ≈øays, <hi>Civil Power not only in general is by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution, but even the a≈ø≈øignment of it ≈øpecifically to the elde≈øt Parents.</hi> By which words I ≈øuppo≈øe he means, (if any thing) elde≈øt Sons; though I know not why he ≈øhould limit it to Parents: for methinks it were very hard the elde≈øt Son ≈øhould forfeit his Right, in ca≈øe he were not a Parent when his Father died. So likewi≈øe he tells us, [P. 19.] <hi>That the≈øe Heirs of this Fatherly Power, are not only Lords of their own Children, but al≈øo of their Brethren, and all others that were ≈øubject to their Father.</hi> Yet tells us not plainly which of the Sons is Heir; only ≈øays a little before, <hi>That when God made choice of any ≈øpecial Per≈øon to be King, he always inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the I≈ø≈øue al≈øo ≈øhould have the benefit thereof.</hi> Though this general Rule was fal≈øe in the ca≈øe of <hi>Saul,</hi> who≈øe Children were di≈øinherited by God to e≈øtabli≈øh the Crown upon <hi>David</hi> and his Line. So uncertain things are In≈øtances drawn from Scripture without any due con≈øideration of the Rea≈øon of them.</p>
               <p>But to return to the ≈øubject: I grant that it is not impo≈ø≈øible but from the command of a Father of a Family, who hath divers other Families under him,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50833:28"/> there may ≈øpring a Civil Government, though the Fatherly Authority doth properly regard the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Children, and the Ma≈øterly Power to encrea≈øe Riches: And though it is not changed barely by the great number of Children or Servants; yet the difference between them is not ≈øo wide, that there can be no tran≈øition from one to the other, unle≈øs a new Right of Soveraign Maje≈øty be produced by God. For if a Father of a Family being provided of a great ≈øtock of Children and Slaves, will by way of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion permit them to enjoy their own Goods and Families apart, on that condition that they ≈øubmit to his Government for their common Security; I do not ≈øee what is wanting to the making him a Prince, if he have ≈øtrength ≈øufficient to perform the ends of a Commonwealth. But he dying, and nominating a Succe≈ø≈øour, if his Sons will con≈øent to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Will, they may if they plea≈øe; if not, all of them, as in an Interregnum, may appoint what ≈øort of Government they will have for the future. Nor will the Law of Nature be violated, if the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt Son, having mo≈øt Votes, ≈øhould be elected in his Fathers ≈øtead.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhould be glad any man could demon≈øtrate to me from the Laws of God and Nature, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s elde≈øt Son was by the Right of Elder≈øhip to be Lord over his Brethren, without their Election or Con≈øent, when their Father died. Indeed the Jewi≈øh Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd a preheminence to the Elder Brother, and that he ≈øhould have a double portion, and be reverenced by all his Brethren, expre≈øt by this Phra≈øe of, <hi>Let thy Mothers Sons bow before thee:</hi> But this proves not that as Elde≈øt Son he had therefore a Right of exerci≈øing all that Authority, upon the Death of their Father, over his Brethren, which his Father had before: Neither had <hi>Jacob</hi> any ≈øuch Right over <hi>E≈øau,</hi> though he ≈øold
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50833:29"/> his Birthright, or the elde≈øt or any other Son of <hi>Jacob</hi> any ≈øuch Right over his Brethren; for certainly God would not have abrogated it if they had. So that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Authority as a Father, ended with his Life: and for any De≈øpotick Propriety or Dominion over them, I have already proved that the Father has none in the ≈øtate of Nature. Yet admitting he had, the Children notwith≈øtanding would have been free at his Death. For Servitude being a mere per≈øonal Duty, due only to the per≈øon of him that acquired this Slave; when the per≈øon dies to whom he owed this ≈øubjection, the Slave is free in the ≈øtate of Nature, unle≈øs the Lord of this Slave transferr'd his Right in him to another in his life-time; a mans Per≈øon not being like a brute bea≈øt, to be ≈øeiz'd by whoever can lay hold of him; he hath no longer any obligation to ≈øerve his Children, (unle≈øs he will make him≈øelf their Slave of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.) But if it be an≈øwered, that the Father may bequeath this Right of Dominion over his Children at his Death, by his Will, to which of his Sons he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed; and that he that is ≈øo con≈øtituted by their Father, is Lord over all the re≈øt of his Brethren; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove this from <hi>Gene≈øis</hi> the 9. <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 25, 26, 27. where <hi>Noah</hi> cur≈øing <hi>Canaan,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>Ham</hi> his Father had derided his nakedne≈øs, ≈øays, <hi>He ≈øhall be a Servant unto his Brethren:</hi> I de≈øire you would take notice, that this An≈øwer quite gives up the Natural Right of the Heir, or Elde≈øt Son. 2. I ≈øuppo≈øe this rather was a Prediction or Cur≈øe to be fulfilled in <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than upon him≈øelf. For fir≈øt, this Right was not given, as it ought to have been, over the Per≈øon of <hi>Ham</hi> the Offender, <note place="margin">

And ≈øeveral Commentators upon this place, do ≈øuppo≈øe that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> related this Cur≈øe of <hi>Noah</hi> upon <hi>Ham,</hi> onely to ≈øhew the Jews the Right they had to make ≈ølaves of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> becau≈øe they were de≈øcended from <hi>Canaan.</hi> And as for the Right of bequeathing ≈ølaves by Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is much di≈øputed whether by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Te≈øtaments have any force in this ca≈øe; tho≈øe that have written of it, being much divided about it in the ≈øtate of Nature, ≈øince all Propriety in that ≈øtate being but Occupancy or Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, which cea≈øes with the life of the Occupant. Therefore ≈øince a Te≈øtament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences onely from the Te≈øtators death, who as ≈øoon as he died, lo≈øt his Right in the Goods bequeathed, ≈øince the dead can have no intere≈øt in any thing; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Legatee ≈øu≈øtain the per≈øon of the Te≈øtator, ≈øince this Right cea≈øed before that of the Legatees could begin. So that it ≈øeems to me at pre≈øent, that the power of bequeathing either the per≈øons of men or goods, was but a con≈øequence of an ab≈øolute Propriety in things which ari≈øes from Compact in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as I ≈øhall hereafter prove.</p>
               <p>Therefore out of this State, a Will cannot bind the per≈øons of the Children or Servants ≈øo bequeathed: And for this cau≈øe we find <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. binding his Servant that ruled over his Hou≈øe, with an Oath not to take a Wife for his Son of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Land.

And if any man think to evade this, by ≈øaying, That the Succe≈ø≈øion of the Crown is a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of the Government, and that a Prince may be Ab≈øolute, and yet not have a power to alter that as he may every thing el≈øe; I would ask him who made this a Fundamental Law at fir≈øt, whether the King then in being, or the King with the Con≈øent of the People, upon the fir≈øt in≈øtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If the King made it alone, ≈øince he is ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to have made it at fir≈øt for the good of the People, of which he is the Judge (and is ≈øuppo≈øed in Law ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to die) why then is not he as competent a Judge of what is good for the People now, as a King that lived a thou≈øand years agone was what was fit for the People then? and con≈øequently hath as much Right of altering the Succe≈ø≈øion for the Peoples benefit, as he that e≈øtabli≈øhed it at fir≈øt, ≈øince every Law may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the ≈øame Power that made it? But if he ≈øay it is a Fundamental Law, becau≈øe long cu≈øtom hath made it ≈øo, then it is apparent ≈øuch a Law hath its force from the Con≈øent of the People at fir≈øt or ≈øince, Cu≈øtom being nothing el≈øe. Or la≈øtly, if he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Con≈øent of the People was nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to make this a Fundamental Con≈øtitution, then it can neither be altered without their Con≈øent; and ≈øo con≈øequently no Princes Te≈øtament is good as to that, farther than the People or their Repre≈øentatives give their a≈ø≈øent thereunto: And the ≈øame Law holds in the Father of a Family, ≈øince this Author will have no difference between him and a King, but onely <hi>≈øecundum Magis &amp; Minus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then there be no Right in the ≈øtate of Nature for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50833:31"/> a Father to bequeath his Dominion over his Children by his Te≈øtament, let us return again to that of De≈øcent, and ≈øee if that will prove a better foundation to build this natural Right of Princes upon. For my part, I think that it is not onely impo≈ø≈øible to know who was <hi>Adam</hi>'s right Heir of his Fatherly Power now, after five or ≈øix thou≈øand years, but might likewi≈øe be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, as ≈øoon as ever the breath was out of his body: For ≈øuppo≈øing <hi>Eve</hi> ≈øurvived him, why ≈øhould not her natural Right of governing the Children which ≈øhe her ≈øelf brought forth (and which out of Wedlock would have belonged to her) revive and take place before any Right of her elde≈øt Son; to whom upon this ground ≈øhe mu≈øt have become ≈øubject, if ≈øhe would continue part of the Family or natural Commonwealth, (which ≈øhe could not avoid, there being none but her Children or Grandchildren in the world) and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again≈øt the nature of Government to allow two Ab≈øolute Heads in the ≈øame Family or Commonwealth? So that for ought I ≈øee, the Mother of the Family hath the be≈øt Right to the Government in the ≈øtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after the Husbands death, upon the Authors own grounds: For if the Commandment of <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> ≈øignifie more than bare Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Re≈øpect, as appears by the Apo≈øtles Expo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Commandment, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Children, obey your Parents in the Lord,</hi> which he makes the ≈øame with <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother;</hi> then this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which was due to the Father, belongs likewi≈øe to her when his power cea≈øes.</p>
               <p>But pa≈ø≈øing over this difficulty, and allowing this Fatherly Authority to de≈øcend to <hi>Adam</hi>'s next Heir, it might have been a great Que≈øtion, who this next Heir was, ≈øuppo≈øing <hi>Cain</hi> to have been di≈øinherited for the murder of <hi>Abel,</hi> and to have gone away and built a City, and ≈øet up a Government by him≈øelf? Yet let
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50833:31"/> us ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>Abel</hi> left a Son behind him, who ≈øurvived <hi>Adam</hi> his Grandfather; which he might very well do, and yet the Scripture be ≈øilent in it, ≈øince the intent of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in his Genealogies being onely to give us the Pedigree of the Jews, and therefore ≈øays little of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Children but by the by. I would ask the Author or any man el≈øe, who was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heir after his death, whether this Son of <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Seth;</hi> (whom we will ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe likewi≈øe to have ≈øurvived his Father?) If he ≈øay that <hi>Adam</hi> might leave it to <hi>Seth</hi> by Will, this is <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis dictum;</hi> and it lies upon him to prove that <hi>Adam</hi> made a Will; or if he did, how it could bind his true Heir. If he ≈øay that <hi>Seth</hi> ought to ≈øucceed and govern his Brethren, as being nearer in bloud to <hi>Adam,</hi> what rea≈øon was there that the elde≈øt Son's ≈øon ≈øhould be puni≈øhed and lo≈øe his Birthright for that which was not his fault, but misfortune, <hi>viz.</hi> that his Father was murdered before his Grandfather died? Nor could <hi>Seth</hi> claim, being elder and con≈øequently wi≈øer than his Nephew: for his Nephew mu≈øt be older, ≈øince <hi>Seth</hi> was not born until after <hi>Abel</hi> was killed. But if it be affirmed, that the elde≈øt Son of <hi>Abel</hi> ought to ≈øucceed and repre≈øent his Father; I ask, by what Law? If it be replied, that it is to be ≈øuppo≈øed that <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had made a Will, would rather have had his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon ≈øucceed him than his younger Son; this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and were to affirm that the Right of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is bequeathable; which I have already confuted. But if it be ≈øaid, that this Son of <hi>Abels</hi> ≈øhould ≈øucceed becau≈øe he repre≈øents his Father; I would ask them, by what Law this Right of Repre≈øentation ≈øhould take place before propinquity of Bloud? or how could the Fathers expectation onely confer a Right to his Son, in that which the Father was never po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of? So that there being equal Rea≈øons on both ≈øides, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law nor Precedent in the ca≈øe, there remained no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50833:32"/> way to decide this Controver≈øie, but either Combate, or the Judgment or Arbitration of the re≈øt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s De≈øcendants. I ≈øuppo≈øe the Author will not allow the former ≈øufficient to confer a good Title, ≈øince the be≈øt Title might have the wor≈øt ≈øucce≈øs in that Appeal to the Sword. If he allows the latter, then this heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Monarchy of <hi>Adam</hi> became Elective, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Will of all the Heads of the Families which de≈øcended from <hi>Adam:</hi> (For it is not likely in ≈øo doubtful and material a point as who ≈øhould govern, any of them would lo≈øe the priviledge of giving his Vote.) And if ≈øo, this Right of Succe≈ø≈øion depended upon their Wills, which might give it to which of the two Competitors they liked be≈øt; and this being once done, might for quietne≈øs pa≈øs into a Cu≈øtom or Law for the future. And that this Right of Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the Son dies before his Father, cannot be decided by the Law of Nature or Rea≈øon alone, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in that divers Nations or di≈øtinct Tribes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have had different Cu≈øtoms about it, and have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtabli≈øhed this Right of Succe≈ø≈øion divers ways: For though the Roman or Civil Law allow of this Right of Repre≈øentation, yet the <hi>Germans</hi> and all Nations de≈øcended from them, did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it until very lately; <note place="margin">See <hi>Grotius de J.

And if any man thinks this onely an Evil peculiar to this Empire, and not to others, let him but read the Hi≈øtories of the ≈øeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions and Changes in all Moori≈øh and Ea≈øtern Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, and he ≈øhall find them managed much after the ≈øame rate. Nor hath the≈øe differences onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the≈øe Monarchies where the Succe≈ø≈øion was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well ≈øettled at fir≈øt, but even tho≈øe that have been better con≈øtituted, and where one would belieev the Di≈øcent of the Crown had been ≈øufficiently ≈øettled by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50833:33"/> a long Di≈øcent of Kings for many hundreds of years. And of this, <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been a famous Example; where after the death of King <hi>Alexander</hi> III, and his Grandaughter <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> two or three ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Competitors claimed a Right to ≈øucceed: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting others, it was agreed that it lay between <hi>John Baylliol,</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> Earl of <hi>Carick;</hi> both of them drawing their Di≈øcent from <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> Great Uncle to the la≈øt King (in whom they all agreed the Right to the Crown would have been, had he ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.) <hi>Baylliol</hi> claimed, as elde≈øt Son to <hi>Dornagilla,</hi> Grandaughter to <hi>Margaret</hi> the elde≈øt Daughter of the ≈øaid Earl <hi>David. Robert Bruce</hi> claimed, as elde≈øt Son of <hi>I≈øabel</hi> the ≈øecond Daughter of the ≈øaid <hi>David.</hi> So that if <hi>Baylliol</hi> alledged his Di≈øcent from the elde≈øt Daughter, <hi>Bruce</hi> was not behind-hand; but pleaded, though it was true he was de≈øcended but from the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Daughter, yet he being a Grand≈øon, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree neerer, ought to ≈øucceed; (whereas <hi>Baylliol</hi> was but great Grand≈øon to Earl <hi>David:</hi>) And though <hi>Dornagilla, Baylliol</hi>'s Mother, was in the ≈øame degree with him≈øelf, yet he being a man, ought to be preferred before a woman in the ≈øame Line; and that if the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> would have given it to <hi>Dornagilla,</hi> if it had been an ordinary Inheritance, yet Di≈øcent of the Crown was not to be ruled by the Common Laws of other Inheritances. In ≈øhort, this Di≈øpute did ≈øo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Nobility into Factions, and puzzle the E≈øtates of the Kingdom, that not being able to decide it, they and all the Competitors agreed to refer the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øie to <hi>Edward</hi> I. King of <hi>England,</hi> one of the wi≈øe≈øt and mo≈øt powerful Princes of his time; who upon long advice and debate with twelve of the learnede≈øt men of both Kingdoms, at la≈øt adjudged the Crown to <hi>Baylliol;</hi> or, as the Scotch Hi≈øtorians relate, becau≈øe he would do him Homage for it: which, <hi>Bruce</hi> being of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50833:34"/> a higher ≈øpirit, refu≈øed. Yet this did not put an end to this great Controver≈øie; for though <hi>Baylliol</hi> was thereupon admitted King, yet falling out not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with King <hi>Edward,</hi> to whom he owed all his greatne≈øs, and having the wor≈øt of it, the Nobility and States of <hi>Scotland</hi> revived <hi>Bruce</hi>'s Title, and declared him King; who after a long War with <hi>England,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the Crown quietly at la≈øt, and left it to his I≈ø≈øue, who≈øe Po≈øterity (in our pre≈øent King) enjoy it to this day.</p>
               <p>To this I ≈øhall adde one Example more from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> within the≈øe hundred years. King <hi>Henry</hi> called the Cardinal dying without I≈ø≈øue, there was a great Controver≈øie who ≈øhould ≈øucceed; (for he died ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ju≈øt as the States of the Kingdom were a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ≈øettle the Succe≈ø≈øion, for he declared him≈øelf unable to decide it:) So that he onely left by his Will twelve Governours of the Kingdom, who ≈øhould govern during the <hi>interregnum,</hi> but that the Crown ≈øhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcend to him that ≈øhould appear to them to have the be≈øt Title. Four eminent Competitors put in their claims: 1. <hi>Antonio</hi> called the Ba≈øtard, who neverthele≈øs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he was lawful Son to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> ≈øecond Brother to <hi>Henry</hi> the la≈øt King: So that he had no more to do but to prove him≈øelf Legitimate. 2. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who claimed as Grand≈øon to <hi>Mary,</hi> elde≈øt Daughter to Don <hi>Duarte,</hi> younge≈øt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the la≈øt King <hi>Henry,</hi> and Son to King <hi>Emanuel.</hi> 3. The Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who claimed as Son to <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> ≈øecond Daughter of the ≈øaid Don <hi>Duarte,</hi> yet alledged his Title to be be≈øt, becau≈øe he was the next of the Bloud-Royal who was a Native of <hi>Portugal</hi> (as the Heir of the Crown, as he pretended, ought to be by a Fundamental Law of that Kingdom:) yet it ≈øeems that Law was not then ≈øo well known, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe there was no rea≈øon why the≈øe Governors ≈øhould
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50833:34"/> not have admitted him King as ≈øoon as ever they met. 4. <hi>Philip</hi> the ≈øecond, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who claimed as Son to <hi>I≈øabella</hi> Daughter of <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ≈øo a degree nearer than the re≈øt to <hi>Henry</hi> the la≈øt King. The States and Governours differing, the States were di≈ø≈øolved; and during their rece≈øs, the Governours not agreeing among them≈øelves, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> rai≈øed an Army, and entering <hi>Portugal,</hi> ≈øeiz'd the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and con≈øequently all the re≈øt of the Kingdom ≈øubmitted to him, and ≈øo made him≈øelf King by force. And yet we have ≈øeen in his Grand≈øon's time, the E≈øtates of <hi>Portugal</hi> declare this Title void, and the Crown ≈øetled in the Po≈øterity of the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who ≈øtill enjoy it by vertue of this Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law. And that this Fundamental Law could not be altered but by the con≈øent of the Cortes or States, appears by the late Alteration of this Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Treaty of Marriage of the pre≈øent Prince Regents Daughter with the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> And how much even Kings them≈øelves have attributed to the Authority of their E≈øtates, appears by the League made between <hi>Philip</hi> the Long King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots;</hi> wherein this Condition was expre≈øt, That if there ≈øhould happen any difference about the Succe≈ø≈øion in either of the≈øe Realms, he of the two Kings which remained alive, ≈øhould not ≈øuffer any to place him≈øelf on the Throne, but him who ≈øhould have the Judgment of the E≈øtates of his ≈øide; and then he ≈øhould with all his power oppo≈øe him who would after this conte≈øt for the Crown. So that our Author, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cau≈øe, lays the fault upon the wilful ignorance of the People in not remembring or acknowledging the right Heir of the Crown; when the able≈øt and wi≈øe≈øt men of the Age they lived in could not by the meer Laws of Nature and Rea≈øon, determine which was he: And our Author ≈øhould have done well to have ≈øet
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50833:35"/> down ≈øome certain Rules, how the People might be a≈ø≈øured, without a po≈øitive Law before made, that they acknowledge the right Heir, and not an U≈øurper to his prejudice.</p>

But indeed Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupancy onely confers a Right in the ≈øtate of Nature to ≈øuch things as are meerly nece≈ø≈øary for a mans ≈øub≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtence; but Government is an Office of Tru≈øt and Power, and which the U≈øurper might very well have lived without: And why ≈øhould a bare po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of this, though of three or four hundred years, confer a better Right than that of a year or two? for this la≈øt po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion ≈øeems, according to the Authors principles, to be the better Title.

But if it be ≈øaid that the Heir of this U≈øurper hath a better Right than any body el≈øe, as having po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and that it were de≈øtructive to the Peace of the Commonwealth to put him out, after ≈øo long an enjoyment of the Crown: it's true, this were a good Argument not to make any alteration in the Government, as it is ≈øetled; but they mu≈øt likewi≈øe con≈øider, that the ≈øame may be as well made u≈øe of by the la≈øt U≈øurper and his Party, ≈øince he having now the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion in as full a manner as he that had it before, cannot perhaps be put out of it, without involving the

It is likewi≈øe as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, when the knowledge of this right Heir of the fir≈øt U≈øurper ≈øhall be ≈øaid to be lo≈øt by all the Subjects. If he means per≈øonal knowledge, when all the people that could remember the Prince that was turned out are dead, and none left alive that certainly know who is his next Heir, the Right of this true Heir will quickly be lo≈øt in one Generation: but if he means a traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal moral knowledge (as he ≈øeems to do) then this can never be lo≈øt as long as there is any Authentick or Hi≈øtorical Tradition of the De≈øcent of this Heir; which Tradition may be continued for a thou≈øand years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: during all which time, the Princes that ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed being Heirs of ≈øuch U≈øurpers, can never require a perfect Right to their Crowns, the Author holding it an undoubted truth, <hi>p.</hi> 60. <hi>That though Pre≈øcription may take away a common Right, yet divine Right (or that to a Crown) never dies, or can be taken away thereby.

Now what ≈øhall they do in this ca≈øe? they mu≈øt either lo≈øe their Liberties, and alter the form of the Government, or acknowledge him to the prejudice of their lawful Prince.

And as for the other in≈øtance of pre≈øerving the per≈øon of the U≈øurper for the mercy or correction of the true Superiour, it had been a very good pretence for Obedience to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> and the <hi>Rump;</hi> nay, to fight for them, ≈øince this was but to pre≈øerve them for his Maje≈øties mercy or correction another time, though their Power might have continued until now; <hi>≈øince they had a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion by the permi≈ø≈øive Will of God, which how long it would endure, no body could tell.</hi> Such untoward things are Arguments drawn from fal≈øe Principles, that they flie in the faces of tho≈øe that make u≈øe of them, and will either reduce them to ab≈øurdities, or el≈øe prove weapons again≈øt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
               <p>But I ≈øhall now come to his la≈øt Refuge, when he can no longer evade, but that by the Peoples ignorance of <hi>Adam</hi>'s right Heir, or of the Heirs to the la≈øt Prince, the ≈øupreme Power is devolved upon the People, who may chu≈øe what kind of Government they plea≈øe, (<hi>Patriarch.</hi> p. 21.) This he denies, ≈øaying, [<hi>That in ≈øuch ca≈øes the Kingly Power e≈øcheats to the Fathers or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Heads of Families.</hi> The ≈øame An≈øwer he gives to this Objection in his <hi>Anarchy of a limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> p. 272. where he replies (very plea≈øantly)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50833:41"/> 
                  <hi>That no King can die without an Heir, as long as there is one man living in the world; it may be the Heir may be unknown to the People, but that is no fault in Nature, but the negligence of the People whom it concerns.</hi>] So that it ≈øeems the next Heir being often not to be known, any man, when the Prince dies, may ≈øtep into the Throne; and if he have Power enough, is next Heir: for a King can never die without an Heir, as long as any one man is left alive in the world; and who can di≈øprove him that he is not the man? So that the power he hath given to his Ma≈øters of Families to chu≈øe an Heir, or one to ea≈øe them of their Fatherly Power, ≈øignifies nothing: For this U≈øurper that can fir≈øt ≈øeize it, may be right Heir to <hi>Adam</hi> for ought any body knows. And certainly having Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, which is the permi≈ø≈øive will of God, he hath a better Right than any other, as we have often heard before: And are told farther in the <hi>Anarchy of a limited Monarchy,</hi> p. 273. <hi>That if the true Heir of the Crown come to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, in ≈øuch ca≈øes the Subjects Obedience to the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power mu≈øt go along and wait upon Gods Providence; who onely hath Right to give and take away Kingdoms, and thereby adopt Subjects into the Obedience of another Fatherly Power.</hi> So that Man is not onely a Creature who is his Goods that can fir≈øt catch him, but, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Author, is in a wor≈øe condition than Brutes: for whereas if a Dog be taken up by a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and a Collar clapt about his neck, and ≈øo led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it is left to <hi>Jowler</hi>'s di≈øcretion how far he will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his new Ma≈øter; and as he may either ≈øtay with him, if he likes his Quarters, &amp; finds him≈øelf well u≈øed, ≈øo ≈øurely he may without any ≈øin, knaw his halter (nay bite the fingers of this U≈øurper of his Liberty) and run away. But poor Man does not onely fall to the fir≈øt Occupant, whom he may not either obey or di≈øobey, as he finds it mo≈øt conduce to his intere≈øt and pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50833:41"/> but is peg'd down to an ab≈øolute Obedience, and obliged in Con≈øcience to obey this U≈øurper (let him u≈øe him well or ill) with the ≈øame re≈øpect and duty as if he were his Father: Which I think God was a better friend to Mankind than ever to intend. But to return to the ≈øubject from whence we digre≈ø≈øed, our Author, for fear he ≈øhould ≈øeem by admi≈ø≈øion of a Power in Fathers of Families to chu≈øe a Head or Prince over them, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anarchy of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy,</hi> p. 272.</note> and to have granted it to them as the whole People, he di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhes, ≈øaying, <hi>It does not e≈øcheat to the whole People, but onely to the ≈øupream Heads and Fathers of Families; not as they are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but</hi> quatenus <hi>Fathers of the People, over whom they have a ≈øupreaem Power devolved unto them after the death of their Soveraign. Chief Fathers in Scripture are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted all the People, as all the Children of</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>as all the Congregation, as the Text plainly expounds it ≈øelf,</hi> 2 Chron. 1.2. <hi>where</hi> Solomon <hi>≈øpeaks to all</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>that is, to the Captains, the Judges, and to every Governour, the</hi> chief of the Fathers; <hi>and ≈øo the Elders of</hi> I≈ørael <hi>are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be the Chief of the Fathers of the Children of</hi> I≈ørael, 1 King. 8.1. <hi>and</hi> 2 Chron. 5.2.</p>
               <p>By all which it appears, that the Author allows in this ca≈øe the Government e≈øcheats to part, but not to all the People, or whole multitude of Men, Women, and Children taken together, to chu≈øe what Government they plea≈øe. And indeed in this ≈øence there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Democracy or Government of the People in nature: for though a Democracy may be defined to be that kind of Government where the ≈øupream Power is in a Council or A≈ø≈øembly con≈øi≈øting of all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: And although it does not le≈øs concern the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children in that kind of Government to be happier than in others, yet who ever thought it a new ≈øort of Commonwealth, and not a perfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50833:42"/> though Women, Children, and Slaves were excluded the publick Councils and A≈ø≈øemblies? And therefore if it be e≈øteemed a perfect Democracy (and was ≈øo at <hi>Athens,</hi> which all mu≈øt grant to have been ≈øo) where onely Free men, or at their own di≈øpo≈øe, and ≈øuch who were ≈øuppo≈øed at fir≈øt to have by their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together in≈øtituted this Government, which is likewi≈øe continued by tho≈øe who have ≈øucceeded into their Places and Rights: I ≈øee no rea≈øon why the≈øe ≈øhould not be looked upon as repre≈øenting the whole promi≈øcuous body of the People, to whom the Power devolves upon the want of a Succe≈ø≈øour. For it is likely that Commonwealths were fir≈øt in≈øtituted by Fathers of Families, having Wives, Children, and Slaves under their Dome≈øtick Government; whom neverthele≈øs they would neither equal with them≈øelves, by admitting them to a Vote in the Government, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet would abdicate their power over them. But then the Author urges, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anarchy of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy,</hi> p. 270, 271.</note> 
                  <hi>If Infants and Children be concluded by the Votes of their Parents, this de≈øtroys the whole Cau≈øe: for if it be allowed that the Acts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents bind their Children, then farewel the Doctrine of the natural freedom of Mankind. Where ≈øubjection of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Parents is natural, there can be no natural freedom: and if any reply, that all Children ≈øhall not be bound by their Parents con≈øents, but onely tho≈øe that are under age; it mu≈øt be con≈øidered, that in Nature there is no Nonage. If a man be not born free, ≈øhe doth not a≈ø≈øigne him any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there time when he ≈øhall attain his freedom: or if ≈øhe did, then Children attaining that age, ≈øhould be di≈øcharged of their Parents contract. So that in conclu≈øion, if it be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined that the People were but once free from ≈øubjection by Nature, it will prove a meer impo≈ø≈øibility ever lawfully to introduce any kind of Government what≈øoever, without apparent wrong to a multitude of People. It is farther
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50833:42"/> ob≈øervable, that ordinarily Children and Servants are a far greater number than Parents and Ma≈øters; and for the major part of the≈øe to be able to vote and appoint what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Governours their Fathers and Ma≈øters ≈øhall be ≈øubject to, is mo≈øt unnatural, and in effect to give the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the government over their Parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Objection I reply, 1. That the Author is here mi≈øtaken, and that there is really an Age of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in nature (as hath been already proved) in which though the Child be indeed free, yet (by rea≈øon of his own want of ≈øtrength and di≈øcretion to judge what is nece≈ø≈øary for his own good and pre≈øervation) is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ≈øubmit him≈øelf to his Parents judgment in all things conducing to that end. 2. That Children, neither Infants or others, are obliged to the Acts or Agreements of their Ance≈øtors in the ≈øtate of Nature, farther than it conduces to their benefit or pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that if a married man out of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ≈øhould ≈øell or yield him≈øelf to a Ma≈øter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily for a Slave, upon condition that his Ma≈øter ≈øhould provide him all the nece≈ø≈øaries of life (without which ≈øuch a grant or ≈øale of a mans ≈øelf cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed good) certainly if he had then no Children, this could not bind his I≈ø≈øue that was to be born, ≈øo that they ≈øhould be perpetual Slaves to all Generations; ≈øince natural Equity, and the favour of Liberty, will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, that the Aliment which the Ma≈øter affords the Children of this Slave, are under≈øtood to be contained under that provi≈øion which the Ma≈øter is obliged to make for him and his, by vertue of their Contract. Or admit that there was no expre≈øs provi≈øion made in the Conditions for the maintenance of the Children, yet in this ca≈øe, I ≈øee no Right the Ma≈øter can claim in the per≈øons of the≈øe Children, longer than 'till he hath ≈øatisfied him≈øelf out of their labour for the charges he hath been at in feeding and providing for them;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50833:43"/> which may very well be by twenty five years of age (as I have already proved.) So that about that time I ≈øee no rea≈øon why ≈øuch Children may not lawfully ≈øhift for them≈øelves, if they do not like their Ma≈øter. And if any Friend of theirs undertake to ≈øatisfie their Ma≈øter before that time, I think they are free, though he ≈øhould refu≈øe to accept it, ≈øince it was lawfully ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Indeed for Slaves taken in a ju≈øt War, there may be ≈øome appearance of rea≈øon, why their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ≈øhould al≈øo be Slaves, ≈øince the Parents accepted of their lives upon that condition that they ≈øhould live in perpetual ≈øervitude, and their Ma≈øter undertook to maintain them upon no other con≈øideration: So that the≈øe Children do implicitely owe their lives to their Ma≈øter, ≈øince he might by the Laws of War have ≈ølain their Parents, and ≈øo they could never have been born. But I will not a≈ø≈øert, that even this ≈ølavery is perpetual in relation to the Children: But as for Subjects, though they are not directly or expre≈øly bound by the Acts or Con≈øents of their Ance≈øtors, who fir≈øt in≈øtituted the Government, yet indirectly or con≈øequentially they are obliged to ≈øtand to what their Ance≈øtors have done; For ≈øince, as I ≈øaid before, no man will deny to accept of the Promi≈øe or Conditions of his Ance≈øtor, if it be for his advantage, and ≈øince the In≈øtitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was for the common good of mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; ≈øo this or that particular Government being for the pre≈øervation and ≈øecurity of every Subject that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys the priviledges thereof, no man can believe that the Po≈øterity of tho≈øe that fir≈øt in≈øtituted this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will go about to undo what their Ance≈øtors have done ≈øo much for their benefit, and reduce all things to the ≈øtate of Nature again. So that as long as they ≈øubmit to, and enjoy the benefits of the Government which was fir≈øt e≈øtabli≈øht by the con≈øent of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, they are ≈øuppo≈øed to yield a tacite A≈ø≈øent to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50833:43"/> tho≈øe Compacts which they long ≈øince made, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely become Subjects to that Government under which they were born. So that tho≈øe that fir≈øt in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Government in any Country, have no nece≈ø≈øity expre≈øly to promi≈øe or engage for the Subjection and Obedience of their Children, or tho≈øe who ≈øhould ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them. And if any private per≈øons will not own this Government, and ≈øo take upon to re≈øi≈øt it, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are not obliged by the Compacts of their Forefathers to obey it as e≈øtabli≈øhed by them; ≈øuch per≈øons, if they enter into a ≈øtate of War, or make Confederacies to that end, may ju≈øtly be looked upon as Enemies to the Government, and puni≈øhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, ≈øince they will go about to di≈øturb the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peace and Tranquility of the Nation for their own private Di≈øcontents or Advantage: for the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once entred into Society, can never be ≈øuppo≈øed to alter their Judgments all at once without very good cau≈øe, much le≈øs to die, though the particular per≈øons that con≈øtituted it do: for as a River is ≈øtill e≈øteemed the ≈øame as long as the water runs in the ≈øame Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, though the ≈øame individual water never ≈øtays in the ≈øame place, but one part ≈øtill pu≈øhes out another; ≈øo tho≈øe are not le≈øs to be e≈øteemed in the politick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity (of a Civil State) the ≈øame people, than tho≈øe by whom the Commonwealth was at fir≈øt founded. And though it is true that Governments may have been at fir≈øt begun by Fathers of Families and other Freemen, who fir≈øt ≈øubmitted their Wills to that of one per≈øon or more, and ≈øo the Women, Children, and Servants, who had had no Votes in its In≈øtitution, might be ≈øuppo≈øed as repre≈øented by their Husbands, Fathers, and Ma≈øters: And ≈øince they enjoy all the common benefits of the Commonwealth, and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe capable of enjoying all tho≈øe priviledges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which are proper and peculiar to Free Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50833:44"/> whenever they come to be at their own di≈øpo≈øal, and that they owe their breeding up and pre≈øervation to its protection; they may well be lookt upon as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an higher Obligation in Con≈øcience and Gratitude to this Government, than Strangers of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who onely ≈øtaying there for a time to pur≈øue their own Occa≈øions, and having no Right to the ≈øame priviledges and advantages of the Commonwealth, do onely owe a pa≈ø≈øive obedience to its Laws.</p>
               <p>But to let you ≈øee more plainly, that upon ≈øuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the Government as the Author grants, not onely the Ma≈øters of Families, as Fathers, ought to have Votes, but all others that are at their own di≈øpo≈øe; I will ask any of his opinion, what he thinks of a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man living in a hou≈øe alone, or with a Wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Children or Servants, or perhaps boarding in another mans hou≈øe for their money, why they ≈øhould not have Votes as well as tho≈øe that are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant Fathers and Ma≈øters? I can ≈øee no rea≈øon, nor I believe they neither. So though the Author by the words <hi>Supream and Independant Heads of Families,</hi> ≈øeems to exclude all Sons from having Votes whil≈øt their Fathers are alive, although they are married, and have ≈øeparated into di≈øtinct Families; yet ≈øince I have proved that neither Paternal Authority nor Filial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is ab≈øolute or perpetual in the ≈øtate of Nature (into which the Commonwealth is by the death of the Prince now ≈øuppo≈øed to be re≈øolved) and if it were otherwi≈øe, yet unle≈øs they will void all tho≈øe Laws and Con≈øtitutions that have been before ≈øettled both for de≈øcent of Inheritances, and the di≈øtingui≈øhing of Property. So that if the≈øe Laws ≈øtand in force during this <hi>interregnum</hi> (unle≈øs they will fall to ab≈øolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion) the≈øe Sons ≈øo making divers Families, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving E≈øtates di≈øtinct from their Fathers, ought likewi≈øe to have Votes in the Government, upon the Authours
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50833:44"/> own principles, ≈øince the Laws of the Country have ≈øet them free from all Paternal ≈øubjection, more than what the Rules of Piety and Gratitude oblige them to. And as for ≈øuch Sons as (though of mature age, yet) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as Servants in their Fathers Families, and ≈øo are under a greater ≈øubjection than tho≈øe that are ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it; I ≈øee no rea≈øon why they may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their Father, as him they could be≈øt tru≈øt, to vote for them, and repre≈øent them in the choice of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; and then they are as much obliged as any man can be by the act of a per≈øon whom he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to act for him, or as the≈øe Fathers of Families would be by Repre≈øentatives of their own chu≈øing: it being morally impo≈ø≈øible, if this devolution of the Government ≈øhould happen in a populous Country, for all the Authors independent Heads or Fathers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ever to meet in Per≈øon to chu≈øe a King; the≈øe being va≈øtly numerous, and divided from each other at great di≈øtances. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anarchy of a mixt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</hi> p. 269</note> So that all the Author's Objections again≈øt a mixt Popular Election will prove as ≈øtrong again≈øt this of Fathers alone: For how, except by ≈øome ≈øecret miraculous in≈øtinct, ≈øhould they all meet at one time and place? What one Head of a Family or Company, le≈øs than the whole Body of the≈øe Fathers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, can have power to appoint either time or place of Election, where they are all free and independant by Nature? and without a lawful Summons, it is mo≈øt unju≈øt to binde tho≈øe that are ab≈øent. So neither can the whole Body of the Fathers of Families ≈øummon it ≈øelf: One man is ≈øick, another is lame, a third is aged, and a fourth (though a Father of a Family, may be under years of di≈øcretion, or not in his right ≈øen≈øes) and many more may have bu≈øine≈øs of their own which they cannot leave, to run two or three hundred miles up to the chief City to chu≈øe a King. So that either the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50833:45"/> People may elect, or el≈øe his Fathers of Families can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, for the ≈øame rea≈øons. And if the major part of the≈øe Fathers ≈øhould agree to chu≈øe Repre≈øentatives, how can this Agreement of the major part bind the minor that did not con≈øent, <note place="margin">Patriarcha, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. <hi>Where the Arguments again≈øt Elections by a major part, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed at large.</hi>
                  </note> ≈øince according to the Authors principles, in A≈ø≈øemblies that take their original from the Law of Nature, no one man or multitude can give away the Right of another? So that though the Author ≈øeems to have been ≈øo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured as to have given the≈øe independent Fathers of Families a Power in this ca≈øe of E≈øcheat to chu≈øe a Governour, yet all this ≈øignifies nothing, ≈øince they can never all meet or agree to chu≈øe Repre≈øentatives: They are ≈øtill like to be his Slaves who can make a Party ≈øtrong enough to ≈øeize the Government, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurp an Authority over them: <hi>Whom yet they mu≈øt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, ≈øince he either is or repre≈øents the right Heir of</hi> Adam; <hi>and ≈øo no body hath a better Right than him≈øelf, who is in by the permi≈ø≈øive Will of God; which how long it will la≈øt, no body can tell. And God does but adopt Subjects into the obedience of another Fatherly Power, or el≈øe they mu≈øt fall into a down-right Anarchy, and every Father of a Family may ≈øet up for an ab≈øolute Prince.</hi> But to return whither we have digre≈ø≈øed; for I have ≈øaid this, onely to ≈øhew that this Authors principles (as well as tho≈øe of others) contradict them≈øelves in this ≈øubject; and either the≈øe Fathers of Families are the People, and con≈øequently cannot, according to this Authour, ever meet or agree to chu≈øe a Prince; or el≈øe the whole People may as well. But ≈øince it may be objected, that it does not ≈øerve to find out truth, or ≈øettle the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion in hand, barely to recriminate and ≈øhew the ≈øame flaws in his Principles as he finds in tho≈øe of others; <note place="margin">

Without ≈øuch a Compact, I cannot ≈øee (according to their own Principles) how there can be an Election of a Magi≈øtrate in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but a meer <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation upon the Priviledge of the World. If any think that particular Multitudes at their own di≈øcretion had power to divide them≈øelves into ≈øeveral Commonwealths, tho≈øe that think ≈øo, have neither Rea≈øon nor Proof for ≈øo thinking: and thereby a Gap is opened for every petty factious Multitude to make more Commonwealths than there be Families in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which Di≈øpute I conceive the Je≈øuit hath gone too far, in a≈ø≈øerting an undivided Soveraignty in the whole Multitude collected together before any Civil Government in≈øtituted; That being onely the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50833:46"/> or Agreement of tho≈øe that entred into it, and binding none el≈øe at fir≈øt. So likewi≈øe this is a meer <hi>Chimera</hi> of the Author's, that <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah</hi> were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute Monarchs and Heirs of the World, ≈øo that no man could withdraw them≈øelves from the Obedience of their right Heirs, without being guilty of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Whereas I have already proved, that all the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and their De≈øcendants, were independant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of their Families, without any ≈øubordination to the elde≈øt Son or Heir. And if every Brother had a Right to ≈øet up an Independant Family or Principality di≈øtinct from that of the elde≈øt, I would fain know what became of this ab≈øolute Right of <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> and by what authority this undivided Soveraignty which God had conferred on <hi>Noah,</hi> was thus crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into parcels. If by Gods appointment, then it ≈øeems God did not countenance this notion of the right Heir of the world: If they did it of their own heads, then all the ancient Patriarchs, or fir≈øt Peoplers of the world, were guilty of Rebellion and U≈øurpation again≈øt their elder Brother and his De≈øcendants. But if the Author's Friends think he hath the advantage, becau≈øe I grant that the World was peopled after the Flood under the conduct or government of di≈øtinct Heads or Fathers of Families; this does not grant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny natural Right in tho≈øe Heads of Families to have an ab≈øolute power over their De≈øcendants, ≈øince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps God divided the Language of the World by ≈øo many Tribes or Families, for the better con≈øervation of the mutual Love and Concord of neer Relations, ≈øince men would more readily obey their Ance≈øtor or common Father, than a meer ≈øtranger; or for other rea≈øons be≈øt known to his infinite Wi≈ødom. So that there was a nece≈ø≈øity that tho≈øe of the ≈øame Stock ≈øhould upon the di≈øper≈øion march off together, ≈øince none el≈øe under≈øtood one another. Yet the Scripture does not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50833:46"/> tell us whether in this divi≈øion and plantation of the World, the Head≈øhip of the≈øe Families was according to elder≈øhip of birth, or whether they elected the fitte≈øt man of their Tribe or Family to be their Leader: And if the elde≈øt were the man, it was not from any Right over them, but either of reverence to his Wi≈ødom, or to avoid the Di≈ø≈øentions that might ari≈øe by other kind of choice on Elder≈øhip; though indeed it confers no Right of it ≈øelf, yet is often preferred as a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Lot. So that every one of the≈øe Heads of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies being independant from each other, they could never agree upon a Ruler over them, but by Compact among them≈øelves: And if ≈øo, he was their Leader that all the re≈øt liked and agreed upon. So that there needed no Compact of all the People of the world, ≈øince every Father of a Family being independant upon any man el≈øe, had a power to confer his Authority of governing him≈øelf and his Family upon whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed: which Power, whether, and how far it was from God, and what kind of Authority it was, we ≈øhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine hereafter. So that though I grant all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be at fir≈øt in≈øtituted by Fathers of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, yet this does not prove any de≈øpotick Power that ≈øuch Fathers had over their Children or De≈øcendants; and ≈øo con≈øequently could confer no ≈øuch Authority over them. So that all the re≈øt of the Authors Queries about the di≈øtinct power of the Multitude vani≈øh, ≈øince though there never was any Government where all the promi≈øcuous Rabble of Women and Children had Votes, as being not capable of it, yet it does not for all that prove all legal. Civil Government does not owe his Original to the con≈øent of the People, ≈øince the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families, or Freemen at their own di≈øpo≈øe, were really and indeed all the People that needed to have Votes; ≈øince Women, as being concluded by their Husbands, and being commonly unfit for civil
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50833:47"/> bu≈øine≈øs, and Children in their Fathers Families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the notion of Servants, and without any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in Goods or Land, had no rea≈øon to have Votes in the In≈øtitution of the Government.</p>
               <p>So likewi≈øe all the Authors Objections and Cavils, <hi>p.</hi> 44. how the greater part of a Multitude could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the re≈øt in the ≈øtate of Nature, ≈øignifie nothing; ≈øince if many men meet to chu≈øe a Governour, the fir≈øt Que≈øtion mu≈øt be, whether the Votes of the major part ≈øhall not conclude the re≈øt; and then all that agree that they ≈øhall, are bound by their own con≈øent; and tho≈øe that will not agree to it, are ≈øtill in the ≈øtate of Nature toward all the re≈øt, and are free to go and ≈øet up a Government by them≈øelves, that they all can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to <hi>Nemine Contradicente.</hi> And if they di≈øturb tho≈øe that have agreed, that they will be concluded by the majority, they may be lawfully u≈øed as Enemies. And for Proxies or Repre≈øentatives, though the beginnings of mo≈øt Kingdoms and Commonwealths, like the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> are hard to be traced up to their Heads or Fountains, and no man can po≈øitively tell the manner of their beginning; yet if they began from ≈øome ≈ømall quantity of men collected into one Army or City, there needed no Proxies at all, ≈øince every man might give his Vote him≈øelf. But ≈øince the Author puts me to name any Commonwealth out of Hi≈øtory, where the Multitude, or ≈øo much as the greate≈øt part of it ever con≈øented, either by Voice or Proxies, to the election of a Prince; I will name him two Commonwealths: The fir≈øt was <hi>Rome,</hi> where all the People or Freemen con≈øented to the election of <hi>Romulus,</hi> being formerly propo≈øed. See <hi>Diony≈øius Halicarna≈ø≈øeus,</hi> lib. 3. And the ≈øecond ≈øhall be that of <hi>Venice,</hi> where though it is true the whole promi≈øcuous Rabble did not chu≈øe a Prince, yet all the Ma≈øters of Families, or Freemen at their own di≈øpo≈øe, had a Vote in the choice of the fir≈øt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50833:47"/> Duke and Senate; which plainly proves ≈øome Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to have had their beginning by the con≈øent of the People. And though ≈øome Governments have begun by Conque≈øt, yet ≈øince tho≈øe Conquerours could never perform this without men over which they were not always born Monarchs, it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily follow, that tho≈øe Souldiers or Volunteers had no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to ≈øerve them, but from their own agreements with their General, and for tho≈øe advantages he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to them in the ≈øhare of tho≈øe Conque≈øts they ≈øhould make. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Read likewi≈øe our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtorians of the manner of</hi> Will. <hi>the Conquerors coming over, and you will finde tho≈øe that helped him in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition were Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed a ≈øhare of his Conque≈øts; which he after made good to them.</hi>
                  </note> Thus were the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> and our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kingdoms erected by ≈øuch Generals of Armies, who not being Kings at home, nor able to ≈øub≈øi≈øt there, were forced to ≈øeek their fortunes abroad; which when they had obtained, they could have no farther Right over the men they brought with them, than what ≈øprung from their mutual Compacts and Con≈øents. And as for Proxies, as there was no need of them in the in≈øtituting of tho≈øe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths we read of, ≈øince taking their Original from all the People of one City or Army, they might ea≈øily give their Votes them≈øelves; but where the People or Ma≈øters of Families are more numerous and di≈øper≈øed than can well meet all together, it is impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, upon the Authors Conce≈ø≈øion of an E≈øcheat of the Crown, that ever a new Monarch can be cho≈øen without their making Repre≈øentatives. As for what he ≈øays about the ≈øilent Acceptation or tacite Con≈øent (or non-contradiction) of the People, no man will ≈øay that it alone confers a Right, where there was none before; as in the ca≈øe of Conquerours or U≈øurpers, whom perhaps People dare not ≈øpeak again≈øt: So
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50833:48"/> likewi≈øe a tacite Con≈øent to a Government, whether Paternal or Civil, ju≈øtly in≈øtituted, does confer a Right, as I have already granted, and ≈øhall now farther ≈øhew in an≈øwer to the Authors Objections. The Author urges farther, <hi>That if Children under years of di≈øcretion, and Servants, are not ab≈øolutely and in Con≈øcience obliged to ≈øubmit to the Votes of their Fathers and Ma≈øters in the choice of the Government, farther than they receive benefit and advantage by it; then every man is at liberty that does not like the Government, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anarchy of a mixt Monarchy,</hi> p. 268.</note> to be of what Kingdom he plea≈øes: and ≈øo every petty Company hath a Right to make a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by it ≈øelf; and not onely every City, but every Village, and every Family, nay, and every particular man would have a liberty to chu≈øe him≈øelf to be his own King if he plea≈øed; and he were a madman, that being by Nature free, would chu≈øe any man but him≈øelf to be his Governour; and ≈øo no man would be tyed to obey the Government far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he found it for his intere≈øt and advantage, and con≈øequently would think he might lawfully re≈øi≈øt it when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he found it impo≈øe upon him what he did not like, or was contrary to his intere≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In an≈øwer to which, I grant, fir≈øt, That every Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øor of a propriety in Land or Goods in any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not onely bound to obey, but likewi≈øe to maintain it; ≈øince tho≈øe that fir≈øt in≈øtituted the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, did likewi≈øe tye them≈øelves and all tho≈øe that ≈øhould at any time po≈ø≈øe≈øs tho≈øe Lands or Goods, to the maintenance of the Government which they had e≈øtabli≈øht: And it is ju≈øt and rea≈øonable, that tho≈øe that claim under ≈øuch fir≈øt po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors, ≈øhould, if they like to enjoy the Lands or Goods, perform the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions annexed to them; ≈øince men may by their own private Deeds, much more by a common con≈øent, change their E≈øtates with what Conditions they plea≈øe; which tho≈øe that afterwards come to enjoy the ≈øame
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50833:48"/> under their Title, are certainly bound in Law and Con≈øcience to make good. Secondly, As for all others who po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing no ≈øhare in the Lands or Goods of a Kingdom, yet enjoy the common benefits of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I conceive they are likewi≈øe bound to obey and maintain it as fir≈øt in≈øtituted, for the rea≈øons before given. So on the other ≈øide, if they do not like the Government they live under, the world is wide enough, and they may remove them≈øelves el≈øewhere: for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that the po≈øitive Laws of any Government do oblige any man in Con≈øcience (who is not a ≈ølave by his own act or fault) never to go out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where he was born, or can oblige him to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain if he once go out of it, or can hinder him from becoming a Subject to another Prince or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, unle≈øs he have taken an Oath of Allegiance to the Prince where he was born, and then he is tyed by his Oath not to act any thing contrary thereunto: And if one man may do this, why not more, and ≈øo on to an indefinite number? But if any Lawyer tells me there is a native Allegiance due by the Laws of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Countries precedent to any Oath, and that in ≈øome Countries (as anciently in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia</hi> at this day) there are Laws that no man ≈øhall travel out of the Kingdom without leave; I ≈øuppo≈øe the≈øe are but po≈øitive Laws, and as ≈øuch bind onely to a ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to the puni≈øhment as to forfeiture of E≈øtate, or the like, but do not bind the Con≈øcience to ob≈øerve them farther than as it is convinced the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is more than indifferent in its own nature, and conduces to the good of Mankind in general, or of the whole Commonwealth in particular. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was this notion of a native Allegiance known to our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ance≈øtors, ≈øince they counted no man an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute Subject until he was ≈øworn in the Tourn or Court of Frankpledge, and was entred into a decenary
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50833:49"/> or Tything. And if it be objected, that upon the≈øe Terms the major part of a people may go away and leave the Government without defence; that is not likely, nor ≈øo much as to be ≈øuppo≈øed, as long as the Country continues habitable, and the Government tolerable for the Subjects to live under: which if it prove otherwi≈øe, I ≈øee no rea≈øon that God ≈øhould have ordained any Country for a common Bridewel, where men ≈øhould be obliged in Con≈øcience to drudge, be oppre≈ø≈øed, and ill-u≈øed all days of their lives without remedy. And as for the other part of the bad con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences the Author in≈øi≈øts will follow, if this natural freedom of Mankind be allow'd, for which you may con≈øult his <hi>Anarchy of a mixt Monarchy,</hi> where you will ≈øee them at large, <hi>p.</hi> 268, 269. <hi>Every petty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hath a Right to make a Kingdom by it ≈øelf,</hi> &amp;c. I ≈øhall an≈øwer him as briefly as I can. The Author di≈øcour≈øes after that rate, that one would think, if it were not for his Principle of Patriarchal Power, men could not ≈øub≈øi≈øt, his being the foundation of all Civil Government and Property. As for the fir≈øt ab≈øurdity that will follow upon the ≈øuppo≈øal of the Peoples pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>That any man might be his own King;</hi> I would ask the Author, What if any man, being weary of the world, will withdraw into ≈øome De≈øert? I think he hath then no other Governour than <hi>Adam</hi> had: Nor is this unlawful; or el≈øe all the ancient Hermits, who in times of per≈øecution retired into De≈øerts, ≈øinn'd in ≈øo doing. But for the ab≈øurdities that follow the ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øal of a natural ≈øtate of Freedom, <hi>As that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular City or Family may chu≈øe what Government they plea≈øe, if they do not like what is already e≈øtabli≈øhed;</hi> I have already granted, that where a Commonwealth is e≈øtabli≈øhed, and men are come out of the ≈øtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and con≈øtitute one Politick Body, all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it are obliged in Con≈øcience to maintain this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50833:49"/> Government according to its fir≈øt In≈øtitution. But if it be to be con≈øtituted anew, as upon <hi>his E≈øcheat of the Crown among the Fathers of Families,</hi> Who are to chu≈øe one? who mu≈øt take upon him this Fatherly Power over them? The inconvenience will be the ≈øame upon his own Principles: For all Cities, Towns, and Families con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting of ≈øo many independant Heads of Families, if the major part of an A≈ø≈øembly cannot conclude the minor (as this Author ≈øuppo≈øes) then though all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families in a Nation ≈øhould agree in the choice of a King, and but tho≈øe of one Town or Family di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, the≈øe Di≈ø≈øenters, if they do not like the Prince the re≈øt have elected, may certainly (if they are able) divide from them, and ≈øet up a di≈øtinct Government of their own; ≈øince all the≈øe Fathers of Families being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like free and independant, can in the ≈øtate of Nature claim no Superiority over each other. So that the Author, from his own Principles, falls into the ≈øame inconveniencies which he finds fault with in tho≈øe of others; whereas indeed there is no ab≈øurdity in this Suppo≈øition.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall now con≈øider in the la≈øt place that part of his Hypothe≈øis (<hi>Patriarch.</hi> p. 21.) where he ≈øuppo≈øes, <hi>That all ≈øuch prime Heads and Fathers of Families have power to con≈øent in the uniting or conferring their Fatherly Right of Soveraign Authority on whom they plea≈øe; and he that is ≈øo elected, claims not his Power as a Donative from the People, but as being ≈øub≈øtituted properly by God, from whom he receives his Royal Charter of an univer≈øal Father, though te≈øtified by the mini≈øtry of the Heads of the People.</hi> I have already pull'd up the foundations of this Notion in the beginning of the≈øe Ob≈øervations, by ≈øhewing that God hath not ordain'd or conferred any ≈øuch Power on any particular Father or other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and therefore neither on all the Fathers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Countries taken together, they not having any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50833:50"/> Owner≈øhip or Property in their Childrens per≈øons, but a Right to govern and direct them for their benefit and pre≈øervation; which Fatherly Right cannot be tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to another, much le≈øs ≈øurvive his per≈øon, as I have already proved. Yet to render this as clear as may be, granting him what he contends for, that this Fatherly Power may be transferred to another; I ≈øhould be glad to know, though the Monarch ≈øo nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by them may have a ≈øupreme Power over all their Children and Servants, yet whence does he derive this Right of commanding ab≈øolutely over the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons and E≈øtates of the≈øe Fathers of Families them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves: Not from ≈øucce≈ø≈øion from <hi>Adam;</hi> for his right Heir cannot now be known: nor from their transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the power of governing their own per≈øons upon him; for then this Right commences from their own Act or Election, and not from the Fatherly power ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to be at fir≈øt conferred on <hi>Adam.</hi> And if they transfer onely their Fatherly or Ma≈øterly Authority upon this new Monarch, then he hath onely a Right to govern their Children and Servants, the Per≈øons and E≈øtates of the≈øe Fathers not being included in this Grant. And again, if this Election in the ≈øtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could confer a Right, then this Monarch mu≈øt owe his Power to the≈øe Fathers of Families; and ≈øo the≈øe being (as I have already proved) the repre≈øentative Body of the People, he mu≈øt receive his Authority as a Donative from them; which he will by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of. But ≈øince he will have him properly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ≈øub≈øtituted by God, from whom he receives his Power of an univer≈øal Father, then the≈øe Fathers of Families do not create or con≈øtitute the Monarch, but onely are In≈øtruments or Mini≈øters to put him in po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion: and if ≈øo, it is the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Crown, and not their Election, that gives him this Right.

And the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had ju≈øt as great a hand in the ≈øetting up and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down Emperours, as tho≈øe of <hi>Stambola</hi> have had in the depo≈øing or ≈øetting up tho≈øe Grand Seigniors which the Janizaries (their Guards) have ≈øtrangled of late years, ≈øetting up their Uncles or Brothers in their rooms; or as the People of <hi>England</hi> had in ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up either <hi>Oliver</hi> or his Son <hi>Richard</hi> for Protectors. But leaving the≈øe le≈ø≈øer Mi≈øtakes, which I look upon onely as the Tran≈øports of the Author's Re≈øentments again≈øt Popular Government, in which I ≈øhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him in the main; onely I would fain lay the Saddle upon the right Hor≈øe, and not blame them for the faults committed by a ≈øtanding Army which in tho≈øe times domineer'd over both Emperour and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and impo≈øed upon them what Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour they pleas'd, though never ≈øo ba≈øe and unworthy. I ≈øhall therefore in the la≈øt place come to the ≈øecond point I before propo≈øed, whether the per≈øon on whom the Fathers of Families upon this E≈øcheat of the Crown confers their Authority, owe the ≈øame to them, or el≈øe immediately to God. The Author (in the pa≈ø≈øage before cited) will by no means grant, <hi>That the per≈øon ≈øo elected claims his Power from the People, but as being ≈øub≈øtituted properly by God, from whom he receives his Royal Charter of an univer≈øal Father, though te≈øtified by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50833:55"/> the Mini≈øtry of the Heads of the People.</hi> Which A≈ø≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is built upon grounds altogether fal≈øe and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as I have already proved: For fir≈øt, he here ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes, <hi>That God hath given by divine grant, all Fathers in the ≈øtate of Nature, an ab≈øolute de≈øpotick power over the per≈øons of their Sons, ≈øo that they may ≈øell or otherwi≈øe transfer this Fatherly power to whom they plea≈øe. And</hi> ≈øecondly, <hi>That the Children are as much obliged to obey tho≈øe to whom the Fathers transfer this Right, as they were their Fathers them≈øelves.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That this Power ≈øo transferred, does not properly derive it ≈øelf from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who ≈øo pa≈øs over their Fatherly power, but to God, who conferred it on them at fir≈øt.</hi> In which Hypothe≈øis every one of the Propo≈øitions are fal≈øe: For, <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> I have proved that no Father hath by <hi>any divine Grant or Charter,</hi> an ab≈øolute de≈øpotick power over the per≈øon of his Son: Or, <hi>≈øecondly,</hi> that God hath given Fathers a power to bequeath or transfer their Authority to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ≈øo that the Grantee ≈øhould by this A≈ø≈øigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øucceed to all the Rights of a Father: and therefore the two former being fal≈øe, the la≈øt of Princes receiving their power immediately from God, which is built upon them, mu≈øt be ≈øo too. And be≈øides, it is evident, that the≈øe Fathers do not onely here pa≈øs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Fatherly power of governing of their Wives and Children, but likewi≈øe that of governing them≈øelves, not as Fathers, but as men; ≈øince they mu≈øt transfer this power, whether they had Wives or Children or not, el≈øe they might onely pa≈øs over to this new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch their power over their Wives and Children, and re≈øerve the power of governing them≈øelves ≈øtill: So that it is plain, there is a power different from that of a Father, to be transferred. But if it may be replyed, They may chu≈øe them≈øelves a Father if they plea≈øe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have heard of a mans adopting of a Son, which ≈øtill mu≈øt be by this Son's own con≈øent; yet I never
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50833:56"/> heard of a Son's adopting him≈øelf a Father, or that a Father, which is a natural Relation, can be created at mans plea≈øure: it is true, a Lord or Ma≈øter may, but he cannot thereby challenge that natural Reverence and Gratitude due onely to a Father. So that if Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have a power of governing them≈øelves and their actions in the ≈øtate of Nature, and that they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this Right on any other, it is evident they do not confer this as a Paternal power on their Monarch, which the Author ≈øuppo≈øes to be granted by God to all Fathers.</p>
               <p>We ≈øhall now come to the ≈øecond Head at fir≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, and examine what power a Ma≈øter of a ≈øeparate Family hath over his Slaves or Servants in the ≈øtate of Nature. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> As for hired Servants, though it is true they may ≈øubmit them≈øelves to the will and di≈øpo≈øal of another what Diet they ≈øhall eat, and what Clothes they ≈øhall wear, what work they ≈øhall do, and what hours of re≈øt or ≈øleep they ≈øhall have to them≈øelves; and that the Ma≈øter may beat or correct him if he do ami≈øs, and through wilfulne≈øs or negligence di≈øobey his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters commands; and that the≈øe are the Conditions that mo≈øt hired Servants, being part of their Ma≈øters Family, do ≈øerve upon: yet is this not ≈øo properly an ab≈øolute Obedience, as a duty of Truth and Hone≈øty in the Servant; ≈øince as he is bound to perform his part of the Contract, ≈øo likewi≈øe is the Ma≈øter to perform what he hath promi≈øed them, ≈øince this ≈øervice is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ab≈øolute nor perpetual: ≈øo that when his time is out, he is free of cour≈øe. And if in the mean time the Ma≈øter does not allow him ≈øufficient Food, Clothes, or hours of re≈øt, ≈øo that he may be able to perform his work, this Servant in the ≈øtate of Nature (if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not per≈øwade his Ma≈øter to u≈øe him better) may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt quit his ≈øervice as ≈øoon as he can; ≈øince he was to yield his Ma≈øter his Labour upon certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50833:56"/> which not performed on the Ma≈øters part, the Servant is not obliged any longer to perform his part of the Bargain, in living with him or ≈øerving him. And as for tho≈øe that have ≈øold or yielded them≈øelves up as ab≈øolute perpetual Servants or Slaves to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of another, I ≈øee no rea≈øon why they may not in this ≈øtate of Nature make certain Conditions with their Ma≈øter, before they will give them≈øelves up to him, ≈øince if a man may covenant with another upon what condition he will ≈øerve him for ≈øeven years, why may he not do the ≈øame for his whole life? So that upon the non-performance of the≈øe Conditions, this kind of Servant hath the ≈øame remedy again≈øt his Lord as an hired Servant may have. And of this ≈øort were our ancient Engli≈øh Villains, who though they could claim no property again≈øt their Lords, either in Goods or Lands; yet if the Lord killed his Villain, the Wife had an Appeal of Murder of the death of her Husband. Since no man can be ≈øuppo≈øed ≈øo void of common ≈øen≈øe (unle≈øs an ab≈øolute Fool, and then he is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making any Bargain) to yield him≈øelf ≈øo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely up to anothers di≈øpo≈øal, as to renounce all hopes of ≈øafety or ≈øatisfaction in this life, or of future happine≈øs in that to come. So that I conceive that even a Slave (much more a Servant hired upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions) in the ≈øtate of Nature, where he hath no civil power to whom to appeal for Ju≈øtice, hath as much Right as a Son or Child of the Family, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his life, or what belongs to him, again≈øt the unju≈øt violence or rage of his Ma≈øter. Nor do I think any places of Scripture, if well con≈øidered, command the contrary: For as for the places in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi≈øtles, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Servants, be obedient to them that are your Ma≈øters according to the fle≈øh, with fear and trembling.</hi> And <hi>Colo≈ø≈ø.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Servants, obey in all things your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters,</hi> &amp;c. does not extend to all things that are, but only
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50833:57"/> to things lawful for them to do, that is, that were not again≈øt the Principles of Chri≈øtian Religion. And in this it is that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18,19. commands <hi>Servants or Slaves</hi> (which there were all one) <hi>to be ≈øubject to their Ma≈øters, not onely to the good and gentle, but al≈øo to the froward. For this is thank-worthy,</hi> or grateful, <hi>if a man for con≈øcience towards God, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>, endure grief,</hi> or trouble, <hi>≈øuffering wrongfully.</hi> Which words ≈øeem to import, that Servants ought to bear with a great deal of bad u≈øage from their Ma≈øters; but does not command them in the ≈øtate of Nature to give up their Lives or Goods to their Ma≈øters, without any re≈øi≈øtance. But if any ≈øhall urge the Example of Chri≈øt alleadged in the third ver≈øe, who ≈øuffered (even to death) for us; I conceive that does not extend to a ≈øuffering or ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion unto all things, but to ≈øuch things for which Chri≈øt him≈øelf ≈øuffered, <hi>viz.</hi> for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience toward God, that is, for matters of Religion; which is likewi≈øe mo≈øt agreeable to the ≈øence of the words that follow: <hi>For what glory is it, if when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? but if when you do well, and take it patiently,</hi> &amp;c. Now who ever can imagine a Servant to be beaten for doing his duty? Therefore doing well, here, ≈øignifies the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øtianity; which they were not to deny, though they had unbelieving Ma≈øters. Therefore ≈øince no interpretation of Scripture ought to be again≈øt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that can never tell a man that he ought to yield up him≈øelf ≈øo wholly to anothers di≈øpo≈øal, as to give his Ma≈øter an ab≈øolute right and power over him to kill or maim him without cau≈øe, or to be ≈øo ba≈øely and penuriou≈øly u≈øed as perpetually to ≈øuffer hunger, cold, and nakedne≈øs, or the like; ≈øo that his life ≈øhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther become a burden and a puni≈øhment, than a ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. For ≈øince we have no notions of happine≈øs but in life, nor in that farther than it is accompanied
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50833:57"/> with ≈øome contentment of mind, no rational man can be ≈øuppo≈øed to con≈øent to renounce all the plea≈øures and ends thereof, (and which onely make life de≈øire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) much le≈øs the Right of living and pre≈øerving him≈øelf. So that even ≈øuch a Slave may without doubt in the ≈øtate of Nature, run away from his Ma≈øter, and ≈øet him≈øelf at liberty if he can, ≈øince his Ma≈øter hath not performed his part of that tacite condition of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; which was, that this Ma≈øter ≈øhould for his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour provide him all the nece≈ø≈øaries of life, and ≈øuffer him to enjoy the ordinary ≈øatisfactions of it. Nor is the wor≈øt of Slaves, that is, one taken in War, ≈øo ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely at his Ma≈øters di≈øpo≈øe, as that becau≈øe he hath him in his power, he hath therefore a Right to u≈øe him as he will: For fir≈øt, as long as the Conquerour keeps his Slave as a Pri≈øoner, and makes him work in Fetters, though he hath given him his life for the pre≈øent, yet there does not thence ari≈øe any Obligation in the Slave to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; ≈øo that the Slave may yet run away if he can, nay, kill his Conquerour, unle≈øs he will come to other Terms with him, and make him promi≈øe him his Service and Obedience upon the granting him his Liberty and enjoyment of the ordinary Comforts of Life: And if he cannot enjoy the≈øe, I believe there is no ≈øober Planter in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> (who are mo≈øt of them the A≈ø≈øignees of Slaves taken in War) but will grant ≈øuch a Slave may lawfully run away if he can. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not true what Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ≈øays, That no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury can be done to a Slave: for his rea≈øon is not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, that becau≈øe a Servant hath ab≈øolutely ≈øubjected his will to that of his Lords, therefore whatever he does, he does it by his Ma≈øter's will, in which his own is included, ≈øo that <hi>volenti non fit injuria:</hi> this proves no more than that the Slave hath no ju≈øt rea≈øon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint though his Ma≈øter give him Victuals that does not ≈øuit with his palate, orpre≈øcribe him Work which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50833:58"/> may not plea≈øe his humour. So on the other ≈øide, what rational man will affirm, that this Slave hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up the natural Rights of living, and being pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a man, but that injury may be done to this Slave as any other Servant, if the Task impo≈øed upon him be beyond his ≈øtrength to perform, or if he be beaten or like to be put to death without cau≈øe, or that he hath not Food ≈øufficient to enable him to do his work? for he may ≈øtill require at his Ma≈øters hands the u≈øage of a man, and of a rational Creature. So likewi≈øe though this property in the per≈øon of a Slave taken in War, may be a≈ø≈øigned over to another, yet the Right of commanding a Slave by his own con≈øent, cannot be ≈øo, farther than it was agreed upon in the Bargain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his Lord: for if he convenanted to be a Slave onely to his Lord and no man el≈øe, the Lord cannot in ju≈øtice a≈ø≈øigne nor ≈øell him to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his con≈øent, nor leave him to his Heirs; ≈øince there might be certain peculiar rea≈øons wherefore a man might ≈øubject him≈øelf to this man, and not to another. So likewi≈øe in ab≈øolute Empires which began purely from Conque≈øt, though it is taken for granted that they may be aliened at the Will of the Conquerour, yet it is otherwi≈øe in Subjects who have ≈øubmitted them≈øelves upon certain Conditions, and who have ≈øome Liberties remaining to them; and much more in tho≈øe Kingdoms which are limited by their In≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for there, not properly the Per≈øons of the men, but the Right of governing them, is ≈øaid to be tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as far as it is accompanied with the Honours and Profits annexed to it. For although a Prince may ≈øay of his Subject, He is my Man, yet this Property in him is much different from that whereby a Prince calls his Hor≈øe his own: for in the fir≈øt ≈øence he means no more than that the Right of governing this man belongs to me, and not to another, yet cannot be extended as far as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50833:58"/> he plea≈øes; but that Property which is attributed to a Bea≈øt or other Goods, includes a Right of u≈øing or con≈øuming that thing as he will him≈øelf, without any other rea≈øon than that it is his own. But although the Laws of Humanity do not permit, that however a man hath carried him≈øelf towards us, all Remains of that Primitive Equality between men ≈øhould be quite extingui≈øhed towards him; and after a man hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a ≈øtate of Peace with us, that he ≈øhould be dealt with as a Brute or inanimate thing: though it is true that the Cruelty and Avarice of divers Nations hath proceeded ≈øo far, that Slaves are reckoned among≈øt Hou≈øhold-goods, and are ordered not ≈øo much by Command, as by the force of an ab≈øolute Dominion and Property; yet this is not from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Civil Law of that particular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. So that though I grant by the Roman Civil Law, a man might have ≈øaid of a Slave in the ≈øame ≈øence as of a Bea≈øt, This is mine; yet this was not from the Laws of Nature, but Cu≈øtom of that Empire, who taking many Captives in the Wars, almo≈øt all their Servants con≈øi≈øted at fir≈øt of ≈øuch: Yet this is not allowed of in our Law, nor yet in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries. And this will ≈øerve to demon≈øtrate what this Author lays down in his Preface to his Ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi>'s Politicks to be fal≈øe, That <hi>Adam</hi> was a Father, King, and Lord over his Family, and that a Son, Subject, and Slave, or Servant, were all one at fir≈øt; ≈øince it may hereby appear that there is a real difference in Nature between every one of them. And though the expre≈øs names of Subject, Tyrant, and Slave, be not found in Scripture, yet the things are, and that as plainly de≈øcribed as if they had been called ≈øo; though the Hebrew being a barren Language, hath not di≈øtinct words for them, without Epithites or Circumlocutions: For (1.) As to Servants, it is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50833:59"/> apparent out of the Law of <hi>Mo≈øes, Exod.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.39.44. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.12. there is a va≈øt difference between Hebrew Servants and tho≈øe that were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations; the≈øe latter onely being called Bond≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who≈øe ≈øervice was perpetual, and who were as a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and Inheritance to their Lords; whereas the former were not to be made to ≈øerve with that Rigour, but onely as hired Servants to be ≈øet free in the ≈øeventh or <hi>Sabbatical</hi> year. And it is frequent in the Law as well as Prophets, to make mention of the Wages of an Hireling. So that nothing is plainer, than that even among the Jews, there was a difference between hired Servants, Hebrew Servants for years, and forreign Slaves for ever. And before that, when <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øerved <hi>Laban</hi> for his two Daughters, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there was then a di≈øtinction between an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Servant and a Slave, ≈øince there was a Contract for what Wages <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øhould ≈øerve him: And though <hi>Laban,</hi> for ought appears, according to the cu≈øtom of tho≈øe times, was an Independant Father of a Family, as well as <hi>Jacob</hi> was afterwards, and con≈øequently a Prince, as this Author needs will have it; yet we do not finde it charged upon <hi>Jacob</hi> as a Crime, no not by <hi>Laban</hi> him≈øelf, but onely as a matter of unkindne≈øs, that he had ≈øtolen away from him with his Daughters and the Goods he had yearned in his ≈øervice. So likewi≈øe, though the word Tyrant is not found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly in Scripture, yet the thing it ≈øelf is, if a Tyrant be one who abu≈øus his Kingly Power to the Oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of his Subjects; or el≈øe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and tho≈øe Kings who after the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> coming out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> ≈øo cruelly oppre≈ø≈øed them, were all good and lawful Monarchs, and had as much Authority as their own Princes which God ≈øet over them: and it had been a wicked thing in them to have re≈øi≈øted them and driven them out as they did, whenever they were able; ≈øince
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50833:59"/> they were in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, according to this Author, by the permi≈ø≈øive Will of God. Having now ≈øhewn the difference of the Power of a Ma≈øter of a Family, from that of a Father, and that the Right which a Father hath in his Children, is divers from that which he hath in his Servants or Slaves; I will now con≈øider in the la≈øt place the Power which <hi>Adam</hi> had, or any other Husband now hath over his Wife in the ≈øtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I have already proved that the Authority of the Husband over the Wife, commences from that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract we call Marriage; and though by the Word of God the Woman is made ≈øubject to the Man, yet the rea≈øon of that ≈øubjection naturally depends upon the Mans being commonly ≈øtronger both in body and mind than the Woman; and where that cea≈øes, the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection will likewi≈øe of cour≈øe cea≈øe, even among≈øt us: For we ≈øee that if a Husband be a fooli≈øh or a carele≈øs man, and either cannot or will not govern his Family and E≈øtate, the Wife may and does, and oftentimes him into the Bargain: Nor does any one finde fault with her for ≈øo doing, ≈øince ≈øomebody mu≈øt govern the Concerns of the Family; and if the man either cannot or will not, who hath more Right or Intere≈øt to do it, than her, who hath an equal ≈øhare in the happine≈øs and well-being of her Family and Children? Neither can there be at once two ab≈øolute Heads in the ≈øame hou≈øe commanding contradictory things, without confu≈øion, ≈øince the Children and Servants could never tell whom to obey. So that even this ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the womans will to the mans, commanded by Scripture, is ≈øtill with a ≈øuppo≈øition that the man is capable or willing to govern: for if he be not, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes this Prerogative of cour≈øe. But ≈øuppo≈øe he is able to govern her and the Family, the Que≈øtion is, What kind of Power he hath over her, as a Husband, in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50833:60"/> ≈øtate of Nature? I grant, that if ≈øhe made it part of her Bargain to be ≈øo ab≈øolutely ≈øubject to him as that he might command her in all things as a Slave, and make her do what work he plea≈øed to appoint, and that he may either turn her away, or put her to death, if he find her imbezilling his Goods or committing Adultery; the woman in this ca≈øe is bound by her Contract, as another Servant, who makes her ≈øelf ≈øo by her own act or con≈øent. But this is not the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion, but what power the man hath naturally over his Wife, as a Husband, ≈øuppo≈øing no ≈øuch Conditions or Bargain were made at the Marriage. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the Wife ought to be ≈øubject to the Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in all things tending to the good and pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Children and Family, or el≈øe the Family would have two Heads (as I ≈øaid before.) But it does not therefore follow, that he hath ≈øuch a de≈øpotick power over her, that ≈øhe may in no ca≈øe judge when he abu≈øes his Fatherly or Husbandly power: For ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe the Father of a Family, in the ≈øtate of Nature, ≈øhould in a mad or drunken fit go about to kill or maim her≈øelf or one of his innocent Children, can any body think this were Rebellion again≈øt the Monarch of the Family, for the Wife to re≈øcue her innocent Child or ≈øelf out of his hands by force, if ≈øhe could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe make him be at quiet? Or ≈øuppo≈øe the Husband in ≈øuch a fit ≈øhould command his Wife to deliver him a ≈øum of money which ≈øhe had in her keeping, when ≈øhe was morally ≈øure that he would pre≈øently play it or otherwi≈øe ≈øquander it away; will any rational man affirm that a Wife may not deny to deliver her Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his own money in ≈øuch circum≈øtances? So that it is evident, ≈øhe never ≈øo ab≈øolutely ≈øubmitted her will to his, as not to re≈øerve to her ≈øelf the faculty of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional woman, as not to judge when her Husband would evidently de≈øtroy her ≈øelf or Children, or ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

But the peculiar ends of Matrimony, which are the procreation and breeding up of Children, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding things nece≈ø≈øary for the Family, may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be obtained, although the Husband be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øted with this de≈øpotick power (which ≈øuppo≈øes that of life and death, or other grievous puni≈øhments) and though the Wife be tyed by her Compact only and the Bonds of Amity; of which Compact the Husband being the Principal, does imitate that of an unequal League between Civil States, in which the Husband being the Head, the Wife owes him all due re≈øpect and ob≈øervance; and he on the other ≈øide owes her maintenance and protection. Therefore I am not of the opinion of ≈øome, who will have the Husband, in the ≈øtate of Nature, to be endued with an ab≈øolute power of life and death over his Wife; and that in this con≈øi≈øts the very quinte≈ø≈øence of Marital power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe, for≈øooth, that all Empire, when it is in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ≈øubject, and neither is exerci≈øed precariou≈øly by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, nor circum≈øcribed by any ≈øuperiour Power, does always import <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis</hi> over the Subject. But this is not ≈øo: for a man, in the ≈øtate of Nature, may become part of anothers Family, and yet make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Suppo≈øition is fal≈øe, which fir≈øt ≈øuppo≈øes ≈øuch an ab≈øolute Empire to be in the Husband, as in the proper Subject; neither is there
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50833:61"/> any ab≈øolute power of life and death nece≈ø≈øary to the ends of Marriage: for if the woman commit ≈ømall faults, and will not be amended, the Husband may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her; if greater (as ≈øuppo≈øe Adultery) he may put her away, and likewi≈øe chu≈øe whether he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Children which he hath rea≈øon to believe he did not get him≈øelf. If ≈øhe murder her Children, or commit any other abominable ≈øin again≈øt Nature, ≈øhe may ju≈øtly be cut off from the Family, and puni≈øht as a common Enemy to Mankind; and ≈øo ≈øhe might be if ≈øhe had not been his Wife; but Servant, or other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Family. Yet I do not affirm, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpotick Empire, or power of life and death, is again≈øt the Laws of Nature, or incon≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øtate of Matrimony, any more than the ab≈øolute power of a good Prince ≈øhould de≈øtroy the love of his Subjects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, or the reverential fear we ought to have of God, de≈øtroy our love of him. Therefore as I have allowed that the woman may confer ≈øuch a power on her Husband over her ≈øelf, in the ≈øtate of Nature; ≈øo I grant this ab≈øolute power may likewi≈øe be conferred on Husbands by the Civil Laws of particular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. Thus it is murder for a man in <hi>England</hi> to kill his Wife taken in the very act of Adultery; but it is not ≈øo in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and mo≈øt other Countries, if he kill his Wife if he find her alone in another mans company, though it cannot be proved they have done any thing cl≈øe to de≈øerve it.</p>
               <p>Having now gone over the whole power of the Head of a ≈øeparate Family, as a Father, Husband, and Ma≈øter, and proved that no man is a Slave by Nature, or without his own Con≈øent (as a Slave by Compact) or without his fault, as a Slave taken in a ju≈øt War; and that no Ma≈øter of a Family hath ≈øuch Right in the per≈øon of one of the≈øe, but that he may do him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury if he take away his life, or puni≈øh him without
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50833:62"/> cau≈øe; and that ≈øuch even ≈øuch, a Slave may lawfully ≈øet him≈øelf free, if the Ma≈øter do not perform his part of the Bargain. And having in the la≈øt place ≈øhewn what power a Husband hath over his Wife in the ≈øtate of Nature, and from whence it takes its Original; it is now time to an≈øwer tho≈øe Arguments and Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by this Author and others, <hi>That the Prince or Governour ≈øo elected by the Fathers of Families, or Frce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at their own di≈øpo≈øe (which I hold to be equivalent to the whole People) hath not onely his Nomination from them, but that it is from God alone that he derives his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power and Authority, with which he is endued upon his fir≈øt acceptance of the Supreme Power; and if he ≈øhould accept it with any limitation, it were to re≈øtrain that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which God hath conferred upon him by his being made the Supreme Magi≈øtrate, and would hinder him from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that great Duty as he ought.</hi> In an≈øwer to which I have already proved, that no ≈øuch unlimited Power was conferred by God to any private man in the ≈øtate of Nature, as a Father, Husband, or Ma≈øter; and therefore could not be given to any Civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, who is ≈øuppo≈øed to have no more power than the Father of the Family had before. A ≈øecond Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, <hi>That no particular man hath in the ≈øtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any power over his own life, and therefore cannot have any over the life of another man; and if one man hath not this power, neither have the People (which is but a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal con≈øi≈øting of ≈øingulars) any ≈øuch power, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot confer it on any other man: therefore every Prince mu≈øt have this Soveraign Power of life and death, not from the People, but from God.</hi> In an≈øwer to which, I ≈øhall fir≈øt of all deny the con≈øequence, that becau≈øe God hath not given a man a power over his own life, therefore he can have none over the per≈øon of another. For God gave man a Right to pre≈øerve, but not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy him≈øelf, and ≈øo cannot di≈øpo≈øe of his own life
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50833:62"/> whenever he is weary of it. Therefore ≈øince the fir≈øt Law of Nature is Self-pre≈øervation, it is lawful for a man to u≈øe all means conducing to this end, that do not prejudice another mans Right in his particular life or happine≈øs; ≈øo that if any man a≈ø≈øault me in the ≈øtate of Nature, I may defend my ≈øelf, and con≈øequently kill the A≈ø≈øailant, if I cannot otherwi≈øe e≈øcape. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will be replyed, that the intention here is not principally to kill the man, if it may be otherwi≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; and that this Right is given men onely to pre≈øerve their lives from being taken away at another mans plea≈øure, but that no private man hath power to revenge an injury done to another or ones ≈øelf, in the ≈øtate of Nature, with death, but God, or him to whom God hath committed this power, according to St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ≈øelves,</hi> &amp;c. I ≈øhall prove that this place does not de≈øtroy that which I maintain: for I grant that all Revenge taken, as the ≈øatisfaction ≈øome men take in the very doing evil or prejudice to another, is unlawful, even by the light of Nature. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Likewi≈øe where Magi≈øtracy is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted, who is to bear the Sword for the puni≈øhment of evil doers? I grant all return of like for like to be unlawful, ≈øince he is appointed as a publick Judge to right tho≈øe that are injured, and maintain the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peace. But no Text forbids men to puni≈øh inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done either to them≈øelves or tho≈øe they have a concern for, in the ≈øtate of Nature; for this is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but a natural Puni≈øhment to deter men from committing violent and unju≈øt actions that di≈øturb the peace of humane Society, ≈øince the wrong doer declares him≈øelf thereby a publick Enemy to all Mankind. And on this account <hi>Cain</hi> feared that (not his Father onely, hut) every one that met him, would ≈ølay him, that is, puni≈øh him for the death of their Brother or Kin≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And if this were unlawful, then all War mu≈øt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50833:63"/> be ≈øo in the ≈øtate of Nature; and Princes being always in that ≈øtate in re≈øpect of each other, could never make any War for the gaining of Rights u≈øurped, or to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh for Injuries received. So that this power which a man in ≈øome ca≈øes hath over the life of another, is onely given him by God for the common good and pre≈øervation of Mankind, of which every particular per≈øon is a part: and ≈øo this power conferred upon the ≈øupreme Magi≈øtrate is no more, nor extends higher than that, though there are more things requi≈øite to the publick peace and ≈øafety of a Civil Government, than are to humane Society in the ≈øtate of Nature: And from hence do ≈øupreme Powers derive their Right of making po≈øitive Laws, and ordaining higher Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments for Offences than the Laws of God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do expre≈øly appoint, as for The≈øt, Coining, and the like. Nor is the Antecedent true, that no man in the ≈øtate of Nature hath a power to di≈øpo≈øe of his own life. For though it may be true that no man hath a Right to make away him≈øelf whenever he di≈ølikes his being here; yet it does not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but that for a greater good to the publick, any man, nay a Prince him≈øelf may lay down his life for his Peoples good: And therefore I doubt not but the Example of <hi>Codrus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> King was not onely lawful, but highly commendable, in facrificing his life for the good and ≈øafety of his People, ≈øuppo≈øing that all their E≈øtates and Liberties depended upon that one Battel; much more for a private man to lay down his life to ≈øave ≈øome publick per≈øon highly u≈øeful to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society. And this much does the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> him≈øelf ≈øeem to admit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7. when he ≈øays, <hi>For ≈øcarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a good man ≈øome would even dare to die.</hi> Where by a righteous man, Expo≈øitors under≈øtand one who had ≈øufficiently done his duty in an ordinary private
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50833:63"/> capacity, yet contributed little to the publick good; whereas by a good man, is under≈øtood ≈øome per≈øon highly u≈øeful and beneficial to others; and for ≈øuch a one a man may not onely dare to die, but actually lay down his life if occa≈øion be. A ≈øecond Objection is, <hi>That if the ≈øupreme Magi≈øtrates Authority be derived from the People, then this Authority mu≈øt be either inferiour or ≈øuperiour to it: If inferiour, how can the People be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or governed by that which is inferiour to its ≈øelf? If ≈øuperiour, how can the Effect be more noble than the Gau≈øe, ≈øince neither any particular Per≈øon nor the whole Multitude had Soveraign Authority, and therefore could not confer it upon others.</hi> To this I an≈øwer, That this Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being but the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the Wills of the Per≈øons that in≈øtitute it to the Will of him on whom they confer it, that he ≈øhould thereby make u≈øe of all their Powers for the common good of them all; and being therefore not any phy≈øical but moral Quality, may be produced in another by their Compact, who had it not formally in them≈øelves before: As from the Voices of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men ≈øinging together, there may ari≈øe a Harmony which was not in their particular Voices alone, though each of the≈øe Voices mu≈øt be mu≈øical to produce it. So every particular per≈øon having before, in the ≈øtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Right to pre≈øerve him≈øelf and to govern his own actions, when many men joyn together to confer this care upon one or more, there ari≈øes a Political Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more noble, yet of the ≈øame kind with the other: for if the ≈øingulars had it not before in ≈øome mea≈øure, the univer≈øal could not have it all. So that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd to alleadge, that Soveraignty is not derived from men, becau≈øe it cannot be found among a mans natural powers or faculties in the ≈øame manner, as it is in the ≈øupreme Magi≈øtrate, as if there were no other than Phy≈øical Qualities in nature; yet even in Phy≈øicks, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>Epicurus</hi> Hypothe≈øes of Atomes to be true,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50833:64"/> there will ari≈øe from their conjunction that quality in bodies which we call divi≈øibility, and yet each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Atome con≈øidered apart, being indivi≈øible, had it not alone. But to an≈øwer a di≈øtinction they u≈øe in this matter between the immediate <hi>efficient</hi> and the immediate <hi>con≈øtituent modus</hi> of Soveraignty; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs indeed, <hi>That by this Election and Transferring of the Power of the Fathers of Families, the Civil Soveraign is declared, but that it is from God alone that he receives his Soveraign Authority.</hi> If they mean by this transferring of Fatherly Power, any ab≈øolute Power which God hath by any Law divine or natural, conferred upon the Fathers over their Children and Families; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, that this Fatherly power is neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute, nor a≈ø≈øigneable to another. If they mean any other Soveraignty di≈øtinct from this, then they mu≈øt needs conceive this as an ab≈øtracted <hi>Ens,</hi> or Phy≈øical quality, which is immediately produced by God, and conferred upon the per≈øon of the Soveraign at his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Declaration: but I ≈øee no rea≈øon of con≈øtituting here more Cau≈øes than needs (as one efficient, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øecundary) or why God ≈øhould do that by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary unintelligible way of acting, which he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by a plain and ea≈øie one, ≈øince it is contrary to his other methods of acting in the cour≈øe of Nature: For <hi>fru≈øtra fit per plura, quod pote≈øt fieri per pauciora;</hi> and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing as I have already proved (and as divers who are ≈øufficiently for Kingly Power do admit) that the People or Heads of Families have a freedom of ≈øetting up what kind of Government they plea≈øe, either Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical or other; and if there were none other but Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtocracies or Democracies in the world, I would fain know what then would become of this notional Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty or Soveraignty? Now if any man ≈øhould ask them where this ab≈øtracted Soveraignty exi≈øts before it finds a King to ≈øettle upon, and whether it be a Sub≈øtance or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50833:64"/> an Accident: if the latter, how it can ≈øub≈øi≈øt without its Subject? or if the former, when it was created whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was at the beginning of the world, or like the Souls of men, <hi>creando infunditur, &amp; infundendo creatur?</hi> or whether there be one ≈øingle Soul of Soveraignty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed all over the world, which being di≈øtributed, does, as it were, animate ≈øo many Kings? Al≈øo whether this Maje≈øty dies with the Monarch, or el≈øe ≈øurvives him as the Soul does the Body, and by a new Metemp≈øycho≈øis immediately transfu≈øes it ≈øelf into his Succe≈ø≈øour. If the Gentlemen of this Author's Principles plea≈øe but to con≈øider the≈øe difficulties, I'll undertake they will finde them as hard to be re≈øolved as any the Author hath propo≈øed about all the Peoples agreeing or being the cau≈øe of this Soveraignty: But I will not deny that God is properly the original and efficient Cau≈øe of Soveraignty as of all good things, and particularly of that power whereby every individual Freeman in the ≈øtate of Nature, hath a power to di≈øpo≈øe of his actions for his own pre≈øervation and the common good of mankind. And the particular powers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men being put together, con≈øtitute that which we call a Politick or Civil Power. And therefore his la≈øt Objection is ea≈øily an≈øwered, That if the People be any Cau≈øe of Soveraignty or Civil Power, they mu≈øt have received this power from God, by which they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it on any other: But it can no way be proved that they received it from God; for God having, as I ≈øaid, imprinted upon mans Soul ≈øuch a tender care of his own good and pre≈øervation, and hath likewi≈øe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to pre≈øerve Peace and Order among≈øt men, in order to the common good and pre≈øervation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and hath likewi≈øe given him rea≈øon to find out all means nece≈ø≈øary for this end, among≈øt which the con≈øtitution of Civil Government mu≈øt be reckon'd as the principal; who can doubt but the faculty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituting
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50833:65"/> of Civil Government likewi≈øe proceeds from God the Author of Truth and giver of all good things? Thus the invention of Cloaths, Fire, and Hou≈øes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, though they were found out by man as his In≈øtrument, for a help to his nece≈ø≈øities and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weakne≈øs. <note place="margin">

And as for other Injuries, ≈øuch as Maims, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the like, they have no certain Judges for any of the≈øe things; every man that is injured in any of the≈øe ca≈øes, being his own Judge and Executioner, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving that Law of an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; onely in Adultery the man hath power to kill both his Wife and the Adulterer, if taken in the act; and in Murder, and great Hurts or Maims, where the party injured is not able to revenge him≈øelf, his neer Relations will not fail to do it; and if they ≈øhould omit, they would be looked upon as Cowards or infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: ≈øo that being naturally loving to each other, and having no words of di≈øgrace to quarrel about, and other Quarrels happening but ≈øeldom, and no man maintaining or taking the part of the wrong-doer, or revenging the death of a Murderer or Adulterer, they have lived many Ages without any common Power to keep them at peace among them≈øelves; and yet they have much fewer Crimes committed among≈øt them than us. It is true, they have Captains or Cacicks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but they have no power but in time of War; and when the Expedition is ended, though they pay them reverence and re≈øpect, and make them pre≈øide in all their Councils and A≈ø≈øemblies, yet they have no Authority in time of Peace to puni≈øh or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion any man. So that if they lived in I≈ølands which were either far di≈øtant from others, or el≈øe were inacce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, and would make no forein Expeditions, they would not need ≈øo much as this Cacick, and ≈øo could live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without any other Government than that of the Fathers of Families over their Wives and Children. But perhaps it will be ≈øaid, the≈øe are Man-eaters and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous People, and ≈øo are not to be quoted as Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the re≈øt of mankind.

But I have done this, onely to ≈øhew an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader what are the true rea≈øons of the nece≈ø≈øity of a Civil Power among≈øt us that have a full propriety in all Lands and Goods by the particular Laws of our Countries.</p>
               <p>Having now I hope di≈øpatcht the fir≈øt part of my intended Task, which was to prove that the Author's Hypothe≈øis concerning the Monarchical De≈øpotick Power of <hi>Adam</hi> over his Wife, Children, or De≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, is altogether vain, and without ju≈øt grounds either from Scripture or Rea≈øon; and con≈øequently that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Fathers of Families, nor the Princes as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting them, can from divine Grant deduce any ≈øuch ab≈øolute Power or Right over their Children or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: I ≈øhall not trouble my ≈øelf with the an≈øwering of the re≈øt of this Treati≈øe, having gone a good way in the ≈øecond Chapter, and an≈øwered his mo≈øt material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections about the Peoples conferring Soveraignty; ≈øo that the re≈øt is of ≈ømall con≈øequence. I ≈øhall not need to examine whether the Jews cho≈øe the King, or God, ≈øince that Government being purely Theocratical, it concerns other Nations not at all; much le≈øs ≈øhall I vindicate the Form of the Roman Commonwealth, or di≈øpute whether they were more happy under Kings or Emperours, or whether Democracies or Tyrannies are be≈øt; or affirm that the People can correct their King, or that there e're have been any Tyrants in <hi>England</hi> ≈øince the Conque≈øt, ≈øince they are all either foreign to this purpo≈øe, or el≈øe ≈øignifie nothing when his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are pulled up.

He finds fault with <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> for making the main di≈øtinction between right Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and tho≈øe that are imperfect or corrupt, to con≈øi≈øt ≈øolely in this, <hi>That where the profit of the governed is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpected, there is a right Government; but where the profit of the Governours is onely regarded, there is a corruption or tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of Government.</hi> By this it is ≈øuppo≈øed by <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> that there may be a Government (which he calls a Tyranny) onely for the benefit of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. That this Suppo≈øition is fal≈øe, may be proved from <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> him≈øelf, to in≈øtance in the point of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. And therefore the Author endeavours to make him contradict him≈øelf thus: <hi>Tyranny</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 7.) <hi>is a De≈øpotical or Ma≈øterly Monarchy,</hi> Now he confe≈ø≈øeth, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>That in truth the Ma≈øterly Government is profitable both to the Servant by nature, and the Ma≈øter by nature:</hi> And he yields a ≈øolid rea≈øon for it, <hi>viz. It is not po≈ø≈øible, if the Servant be de≈øtroyed, the Ma≈øter≈øhip can be ≈øaved.</hi> Whence it may be inferred, <hi>That if the Ma≈øterly Government of Tyrants cannot be ≈øafe without the pre≈øervation of them whom they govern,</hi> it will follow, <hi>That a Tyrant cannot govern for his own profit onely.</hi> And thus his main definition of Tyranny fails, as being grounded on an impo≈ø≈øible Suppo≈øition. By his own confe≈ø≈øion, no Example can be ≈øhewn of any ≈øuch Government that ever was in the world, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtotle</hi> de≈øcribes Tyranny to be: for under the wor≈øt of Kings, though many particular men have unju≈øtly ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, yet the Multitude, or People in general, have
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50833:70"/> found benefit and profit by the Government.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> were alive, I doubt he would ≈øay this Author plaid the Sophi≈øter with him, and did not onely mi≈øquote his words, but pervert his meaning. For fir≈øt, <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> does not ≈øay in that place he quotes, (or in any other that I know of) <hi>That Tyranny is a De≈øpotical or Ma≈øterly Monarchy:</hi> And therefore all he builds upon this Conce≈ø≈øion is fal≈øe. It is true indeed, <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> ≈øays, <hi>That the Government of the Ma≈øter is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table both to the Servant by nature, and the Ma≈øter by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> (that is, upon his ≈øuppo≈øition that they are either ≈øo by nature.) But the Author omits what immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows, becau≈øe it would vindicate <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi>'s true meaning: for his next words are, <hi>Neverthele≈øs it</hi> (i. e. the Ma≈øterly power) <hi>regards chiefly the profit of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, and of the Servant but by accident; but Oecumenical Government, or that of a Ma≈øter over the Wife, Children, and Servants, is for their ≈øakes whom he governs, and for the common good of them all.</hi> Hence it appears plainly, that <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> when he ≈øays that a Tyranny is for the benefit of the Governour alone, he does not mean that the Subjects can have no benefit at all by it, ≈øince it is the Tyrants intere≈øt they ≈øhould live and get Children, or el≈øe he would quickly want Subjects. Thus the Children of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> under the Tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> had Meat, Drink, and Cloaths, and were not ≈øo low kept but they got Children apace; and yet we find God thought them oppre≈øt, and heard their cry. But <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtotle</hi> clears the point, when he di≈øtingui≈øhes an ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Ma≈øterly power over a Slave, from that of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Family; the Ma≈øter in the former con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely his own profit, and the pre≈øervation of the Slave but by accident; and ≈øo an ill-natured bruti≈øh Ma≈øter takes care of the life of his Slave that works in the Mines or Sugar-works in the <hi>Indies,</hi> not out of any love to the per≈øon of the Slave, but becau≈øe he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50833:70"/> cannot ≈øub≈øi≈øt without him. So a Gra≈øier or Butcher takes care of his Cattel that they thrive and do well (as they call it) yet every body knows that they take this care onely for their Carca≈ø≈øes, which yield them ≈øo much ready money at the Market. So that indeed a Tyrant onely con≈øiders his own good in the welfare of his Subjects, and looks upon them as no better than brute Bea≈øts, in which he hath an ab≈øolute property to ≈øhear or kill, as he thinks it mo≈øt conduces to his own profit; without con≈øidering to what end he is ≈øet over them: As the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> makes u≈øe of the bodies of his poor Chri≈øtian-≈ølaves (for Subjects I cannot call them) to fill up Ditches, and to blunt the edge of his Enemies Swords. But that all Kings are bound to pre≈øerve the Lands, Goods, and Lives of their Subjects, the Author him≈øelf confe≈ø≈øes, (<hi>Patriarcha,</hi> p. 94.) <hi>Though not by any municipal Law, ≈øo much as the natural Law of a Father, which binds them to ratifie the Acts of their Forefathers and Predece≈ø≈øors in things nece≈ø≈øary for the publick good of their Subjects.</hi> So then I hope there is ≈øome difference between the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Father over his Children, and that of an ab≈øolute Lord over his Slaves, notwith≈øtanding our Author's Quotation out of <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> whereby he would make them all one, <hi>viz. That a Kingdom will be a Fatherly Government:</hi> Which is true, if you take it in the be≈øt ≈øence, for that affection that Kings like Fathers ≈øhould have for their Subjects: And ≈øo it is plain <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> intended it, by the words immediately foregoing, thus; <hi>For the Society of a Father with his Sons, has an appearance of a Kingdom;</hi> not that it is ≈øo indeed.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50833:71"/> yet implicitly he does, ≈øince at the fir≈øt in≈øtitution of the Government, the fir≈øt Compact was, That the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the major part ≈øhould conclude the whole A≈ø≈øembly; and whoever either then would not, or now refu≈øes to be ≈øo concluded, is ≈øtill in the ≈øtate of Nature, in re≈øpect of all the re≈øt, and is not to be lookt upon as a Member of that Commonwealth, but as an Enemy, and a Covenant-breaker.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall not quarrel with the Author, if he hold that Monarchy does mo≈øt conduce to the main ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Religion towards God, and Peace towards men; ≈øince I agree with him, that ab≈øolute Monarchy (if a man could be ≈øure the Monarch would ≈øtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue prudent and ju≈øt) were the be≈øt ≈øort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for mankind. Onely I cannot but ≈ømile to finde the Author (<hi>p.</hi> 27.) ≈øo much admire the high re≈øpect the great Turk pays the <hi>Mufti</hi> or chief Bi≈øhop, as he calls him, (where by the by, I never heard the Turki≈øh Church-Government was Epi≈øcopal before) yet every printed Relation can tell us, that this wonderful Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is but a meer piece of Pageantry, the Idol being of his own making, and whom he again unmakes at his plea≈øure; a ≈øort of Ordination I ≈øuppo≈øe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would not allow to tho≈øe of an indelible Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. It is true indeed what the Author affirms, (<hi>p.</hi> 29.) That <hi>Rome,</hi> being in any de≈øperate condition, was ≈øtill forced to flie to Monarchy, chu≈øing a Dictator with ab≈øolute Power: Yet this was onely as a General in time of War, or ≈øome great civil Commotion being very near it; where it mu≈øt be confe≈øt that the ab≈øolute power of one is be≈øt at ≈øuch times, which needed a ≈øpeedy Remedy: And argues no more the <hi>Romans</hi> good opinion of Monarchy, than it does any mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Martial Law; which though perhaps the be≈øt that can be u≈øed in War, it will not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that it were to be cho≈øen in times of Peace, no
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50833:72"/> more than becau≈øe Brandy may do a man good when he is ≈øick in his ≈øtomach, therefore he ought to drink it con≈øtantly. So that as one benefit of the Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip was the help it gave them upon an Extremity, ≈øo the next happine≈øs they wi≈øht for after that was over was, that the Dictator would lay down his Office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were never more ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over and oppre≈øt, than when the≈øe Dictators held their Power by force, contrary to their In≈øtitution, and longer than there was need of them; as may be ≈øeen in the Examples of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Cae≈øar.</hi> But the Con≈øuls, though they had in many things (e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in calling the Senate, and in commanding the Army) a Kingly power, yet it was not ab≈øolute, but was liable to be que≈øtioned by the Senate and People; as any man that reads the Roman Hi≈øtory may ob≈øerve. [<hi>See the Oration of</hi> Valerius <hi>in</hi> Diony≈øius Halicarna≈ø≈øaeus, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>upon the difference between the Senate and People.</hi>] I ≈øhall not now ≈øtay to di≈øpute whether the People of <hi>Rome</hi> did well or ill in expelling <hi>Tarquin;</hi> but be≈øides his per≈øonal faults, he was never their lawful King having a≈øcended the Throne by the murder of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> and kept it by the power of a ≈øtanding Army, without the due Election of the Senate and People; which was contrary to the In≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of that Kingdom, which was Elective.</p>
               <p>The Author (<hi>p.</hi> 32.) makes a great difficulty to grant the Roman Commonwealth to be Popular: It is true, it was not ≈øo ab≈øolutely, but was mixt with an Ari≈øtocracy in the Government of the Senate, and with Regal power in the Authority of the Con≈øuls; yet it is plain, the ≈øupreme Power remained in the Body of the People: And though by the unequal divi≈øion of the Centuries, it is true, the greater part of the common People were ≈øeldom admitted to vote, being concluded by the major part of the fir≈øt 97 Centuries, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted

               <p>I Shall therefore in the next place look over his mi≈øcellany ob≈øervations. (1) Upon divers modern Authors. As for Mr. <hi>Hob's Leviathan.</hi> I ≈øhall leave them to decide the controver≈øie as they plea≈øe, and refer it to the readers judgment who hath the better on't: For in many things I think neither of them are in the right: only it is a hundred pitties Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> did not con≈øult the Author, and take in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcal Hypothe≈øis, and then all his rights of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øing Soveraign Tyranny would have gone down well enough. But for my part I neither like the <hi>foundation</hi> nor the building which Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> hath ≈øet up, and therefore ≈øhall here leave the Author to build and pull down as he plea≈øes without my intermedling.</p>
               <p>And le≈øs ≈øhall I take upon me to vindicate <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> ≈øince that were at once to defend downright Murder and Rebellion. So that I ≈øhall turn over to his ob≈øervations upon <hi>Grotius,</hi> an Author of greater learning, and better reputation, than either of them. Where I ≈øhall not trouble my ≈øelf to defend the manifold di≈øtinctions, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 37.</note> and contradictions of the old Civil Lawyers about the Law of Nature, and the Law of Nations; or whether the natural, and Moral law be all one, it is ≈øufficient if <hi>Grotius</hi>'s didifinition of the law of Nature be true: Nor does it ≈øignifie any thing whether the word Law of nature be found in Scripture; Yet I think <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> may well enough be defended, that there is ≈øuch a thing too proved from 11. <hi>Romans v.</hi> 14, 15. For though he doth not ≈øay expre≈øly that nature is a Law unto them, but <hi>they are a law unto them≈øelves,</hi> yet certainly Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is to the ≈øame: For if the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50833:74"/> 
                  <hi>Gentiles</hi> by nature <hi>did the things contained in the law,</hi> and ≈øo were a law unto them≈øelves, I know not what el≈øe he can mean by their doing by nature <hi>the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the law,</hi> but their living according to the Laws of nature or right rea≈øon, which (all rational men are ≈øen≈øible of as ≈øoon as they come of an age able to exert this faculty and ≈øo) becomes by nature a Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them≈øelves; neither can this be cu≈øtom, ≈øince Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øays they do ≈øo by nature <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law.</p>
               <p>Neither do I ≈øee any Rea≈øon why <hi>Grotius</hi> is to be blamed for not taking his Hypothe≈øis concerning the Original of Mankind, of Dominion, and Property out of <hi>Gene≈øis,</hi> ≈øince writing of the rights of Peace and War according to the laws of nature, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral con≈øent of civili≈øed Nations, and not according to any revealed Will, or Law of God he was not bound (nay it was contrary to his purpo≈øe) to make u≈øe of Scripture farther than to confirm what could be made out from natural rea≈øon alone, for to have done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe had been to have written a treati≈øe of ca≈øes of Con≈øcience in Divinity, and not of right and wrong by the laws of nature. So that though he ≈øometimes make u≈øe of Texts of Scripture, yet it is either to ≈øtrengthen tho≈øe, or el≈øe to an≈øwer ≈øome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that may be drawn from thence again≈øt his conclu≈øions. And therefore he was not obliged to take notice, whether God gave a begining to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from one man, or more at once, ≈øince it might if he had plea≈øed have been either way. Nor yet did he dream of <hi>Adams</hi> Monarchy over the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before he had any Subjects to command, nor of his being ≈øole Lord Proprietor and fir≈øt occupant of all the earth, and of all the Creatures in it, when neither he, nor his Children ever knew, nor made any u≈øe of the 1000. <hi>parts;</hi> of them, the≈øe were No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50833:74"/> too fine ≈øpun for a man of his ≈øolid judgment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to light on, ≈øo therefore we mu≈øt be beholding to our Author and ≈øome Engli≈øh Divines for this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable di≈øcovery. Yet as I doubt not but if that great man were alive, he could well enough defend him≈øelf by that great rea≈øon, and learning he was Ma≈øter of, again≈øt what ever this Author or ≈øome other le≈ø≈øer Scriblers could rea≈øonably object again≈øt a work of that nature; yet I doubt not but mo≈øt of tho≈øe things the Author ob≈øerves as errors, may be well enough defended by one of far meaner parts, and le≈øs learning than <hi>Grotius</hi> him≈øelf; ≈øo that I am not convinced that he either forgets or contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf (as our Author will needs have him) when he refers <hi>alieni ab≈øtinentia</hi> or ab≈øtaining from that which belongs to another, <note place="margin">

               <p>In an≈øwer to which, it will appear that a Propriety of occupancy or the per≈øonal po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of things and applying it to the u≈øe of one or more men while they have need of it, may very well con≈øi≈øt with commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to the pre≈øervation of Mankind: As for Example, a Theater is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all that have a right of coming thither, but no man can ≈øay that one place in it is more his than anothers, untill he is ≈øeated in it, and then that place is ≈øo much his, that while≈øt the Play la≈øts no man can without injury put him out of it; ≈øo likewi≈øe ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing the Earth and fruits thereof to have been at fir≈øt be≈øtowed in Common on all its inhabitants; yet ≈øince Gods fir≈øt Command to man was, encrea≈øe and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50833:75"/> multiply, if he hath a right to perform the end, he hath certainly a right to the means of his pre≈øervation, and the propagation of his ≈øpecies, ≈øo that though the fruits of the earth, or bea≈øts, for food were all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet when once any man had by his own labour acquired ≈øuch a proportion of either as would ≈øerve the nece≈ø≈øities of him≈øelf, and Family, they became ≈øo much his own, as that no man could without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt inju≈øtice rob him of the≈øe nece≈ø≈øities of life; and this ≈øort of Community was mo≈øt Primitive, and Natural, being ≈øtill retained among the <hi>Americans</hi> to this day, the re≈øt of the Country lying ≈øtill in common, neither can any <hi>Indian</hi> pre≈øcribe to this or that Tree, that grows out of his own Garden, or to any of the wild Bea≈øts, that this is his more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, until he hath either gathered tho≈øe or killed the other, and then all look upon it as robbery to take from each other, what they are once po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of; ≈øo likewi≈øe in this ≈øtate of Community, if an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> make a bargain with another to give him ≈øome of his venizon for ≈øuch a proportion of maiz or roots, there is never an hone≈øt <hi>Indian</hi> but will judge the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker bound to make good his bargain without any di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; ≈øo likewi≈øe if any two or more of them make a bargain to go a hunting, or fi≈øhing together, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that the Venizon, or Fi≈øh that they ≈øhall take be equally divided among≈øt them all, I think every one of them will think him≈øelf wronged if one of them cheat or ≈øteal from the re≈øt before the quarry come to be divided. So that you may ≈øee how true it is which this Author affirms, <hi>that if all things were common by nature there could be no contracts, agreeable to which is the Hypothe≈øis layd down by</hi> Grotius; <q rend="inline">'that God imediately after the Creation did be≈øtow upon Mankind in general a right over all things of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerior nature, from whence it came to pa≈øs, that pre≈øently every man might take what he would for

               <p>But it ≈øeems our Author will have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Scripture, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 46.</note> becau≈øe Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Mare clau≈øum</hi> (from I know not what Tradition of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>) <q rend="inline">'<hi>≈øuppo≈øes that</hi> Adam <hi>by donation from God, Gen.</hi> 1.28. was made general Lord of all things, not without ≈øuch a private dominion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf as (without his grant) did exclude his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that by donation, a≈ø≈øgnation, or ≈øome kind of ce≈ø≈øion (before he was dead or left any heir to ≈øucceed him) his Children had their di≈øtinct terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by private dominion; <hi>Abel</hi> had his flocks, and pa≈øtures for them; <hi>Cane</hi> had his fields for Corn, and the land of <hi>Nod</hi> where he built him≈øelf a City.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the confutation of which opinion, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved that <hi>Adams</hi> ab≈øolute dominion over the lives and per≈øons of his Children is not to be deduced from that place of <hi>Gene≈øis,</hi> before cited by Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi> Let us now con≈øider whether <hi>Adam</hi> had by the≈øe words an ab≈øolute dominion over the world and all things therein, di≈øtinct from that of his wife and Children, <hi>the words are Male and Female created he them, and God ble≈ø≈øed them, and God ≈øaid unto them, be fruitful and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iply and repleni≈øh the Earth, and ≈øubdue it, and have do minion over the Fi≈øh of the Sea, and over the Fowel of the Air; and over every living thing that moveth upon the face of the Waters.)</hi> From whence it may be ob≈øerved, 1. That though the≈øe words are placed before the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Eve</hi> by a Prolep≈øis (very u≈øual in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) yet it is apparent that they mu≈øt have been ≈øpoken after it, by the≈øe words male and female cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated he them, ≈øince <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> could not ≈øpeak of a Female untill the woman was made. 2. That this Dominion over the creatures is given unto them both joyntly, the grant of the Dominion as well as the ble≈ø≈øing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50833:76"/> given alike to them. And God ble≈ø≈øed them, and ≈øaid unto them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. That it does not appear that this Dominion was per≈øonal to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> alone, exclu≈øivly to their Children, and de≈øcendents, ≈øo that none of them could eat, or di≈øpo≈øe of any fruits of the Earth for the ≈øupplying of the nece≈ø≈øities of nature without their leave, for the words are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Male and Female created he them; and ≈øo ≈øeem, though ≈øpoke to the per≈øons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> as the Protopla≈øts of Mankind to relate to all the Males, and Females that ever ≈øhould be born. 4. That this Dominion was not ab≈øolute to di≈øpo≈øe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as they plea≈øed, ≈øince the previledge of u≈øing them for food was not given until after the flood. So if the≈øe words in <hi>Gene≈øis</hi> do not prove an ab≈øolute Dominion in <hi>Adam,</hi> over all things, I do not ≈øee any other place that can; for though it is true that God after the fall made the woman ≈øubject to her husband; yet I do not ≈øee why ≈øhe ≈øhould therefore loo≈øe her right of pre≈øerving her ≈øelf by the fruits of the earth, or her u≈øing any of the Creatures, ≈øuppo≈øe the milk of a Cow without her husbands con≈øent. For if <hi>Adam</hi> had been at any time in an ill humour (all the things in the world being his) ≈øhould he have but forbid her to eat any of them without his leave, our great Grandmother might have ≈øtarved without all remedy.</p>
               <p>So likewi≈øe had he been at any time angry with any of his Sons, and had forbid them to touch ≈øo much as an Apple, they mu≈øt either have peri≈øhed, or if they had filled their bellys, been at once guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Theft, and di≈øobedience; ≈øo that it had been in his power without any violence to have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their lives when he plea≈øed. But I cannot think it rational, neither is it con≈øonant to Scripture, that God gave <hi>Adam</hi> ≈øuch a de≈øpotick power over all things; for ≈øince all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> had as much right to their lives as <hi>Adam</hi> had him≈øelf, it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50833:76"/> mu≈øt likewi≈øe follow, that they had as good a right to the fruits of the earth, which were then the only means to maintain it, and con≈øequently might have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their bellies when they plea≈øed with any of the natural products of the earth, without their Fathers leave; for the P≈øalmi≈øt ≈øaith, God gave the Earth to the Children of men, that is, not to any one man, nor yet ab≈øolutely in common, but to be either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, or u≈øed in common, as they ≈øhould find it ≈øtand be≈øt with their convenience and way of living; ≈øo that I ≈øhall not much di≈øpute with the Author whether <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> had their ≈øeparate Pa≈øtures for their Flocks by the A≈ø≈øignment of their Father; though I believe it will be a pretty hard task to prove that <hi>Cain,</hi> when he ran away for his brothers murder, enjoyed the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> where he built a City by his fathers ≈øettlement. But though Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and the Author agree very well about the di≈øtinct Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet they do not ≈øo concerning that of <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Sons, whom Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> (and I think with very good rea≈øon) from <hi>Gen. IX.</hi> 2. Will have to be joynt Commonors with their Father in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the world and all its creatures; but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ≈øays, that the Text doth not warrant it. <q rend="inline">'For though the Sons are mentioned in the ble≈ø≈øing, yet it may be be≈øt under≈øtood with a ≈øubordination, or benediction in ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, the ble≈ø≈øing might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, if the Sons either under or after their Father enjoyed a private dominion:</q> It is apparent that the words rather warrant the contrary. For the Text does not mention any ble≈ø≈øing in ≈øubordination but is alike in pre≈øent to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, for God ≈øpake to <hi>Noah</hi> and to his Sons, and ≈øo is their power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the creatures: as appears <hi>v.</hi> 3.

As for <hi>Noah</hi>'s being ≈øole heir of the world, he takes that for granted (which is no law of nature) that in the ≈øtate of nature one man is more an heir to his Father (or any other relation) than another; but having confuted that opinion already, I need ≈øay no more of it here.</p>

If by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity he means proof out of Scripture; that neither makes for or again≈øt this opinion, the Scriptures not being written to ≈øhew us the originals either of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or Propriety, any more than to teach men Chymi≈øtry or A≈øtronomy, though there be ≈øome ≈øo ≈øotti≈øh to think they thus find ≈øome grounds for their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50833:77"/> Fancies in tho≈øe ≈øtudies; yet it appears that the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was all, or mo≈øt of it in Common in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time, or el≈øe he could never have lived, and kept his flocks upon it as a ≈øeparate Ma≈øter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, without becoming ≈øubject to any other Prince. But however I look upon this Tradition delivered by the Greek and Latin Authors every whit as good as that Jewi≈øh one which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> quotes out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øebius, and Cednenus:</hi> though he does not lay any ≈øtre≈øs upon it. But our Author admits it as an undeniable Record. That <hi>Noah</hi> him≈øelf as Lord of all was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the di≈øtribution of the world, and of all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate dominion, and that by an appointment of an oracle from God he did confirm this Di≈øtribution by <q rend="inline">'his la≈øt Will and Te≈øtament, which at his death he left in the hands of <hi>Shem,</hi> his elde≈øt Son, and al≈øo warned all his Sons that none of them ≈øhould invade any of their brothers dominions, or injure one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becau≈øe from thence di≈øcord, and civil war, would en≈øue.</q> Its not likely that the Antient <hi>Jews</hi> ≈øhould know any thing of this Will of <hi>Noahs,</hi> for if they had, ≈øo diligent an Author, and ≈øo well ver≈øed in the Jewi≈øh Antiquities as <hi>Jo≈øephus,</hi> would not have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ≈øo famous a piece of hi≈øtory. 2. The <hi>Rahbins</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, and con≈øequently our Fathers of the Church are not agreed whether <hi>Shem</hi> or <hi>Japhet</hi> were the elde≈øt. For though it is true that St. <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> and tho≈øe Fathers that follow the vulgar tran≈ølation, made <hi>Shem</hi> the elde≈øt; yet St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom,</hi> and all the Fathers of the Greek Church, who therein follow the <hi>LXX. Ver≈øior,</hi> as of greater Antiquity and Authority, are for <hi>Japhets</hi> being the elde≈øt brother: So that this Te≈øtament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left in <hi>Shems</hi> hands is a meer Rabinical inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it being much to be doubted whether Letters, much more Wills in writing were in fa≈øhion, in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s days, and if <hi>Noah</hi> left no Will, which no Jury
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50833:78"/> can now decide) then the world was left to <hi>Noahs</hi> Sons, Grand-children in Common to be divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ≈øeveral occa≈øions, ≈øince they all three had equal right to it: But it ≈øeems a weak Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis if it ≈øerve the Authors pre≈øent purpo≈øe ≈øhall be received, though it contradict his other Principles: For in his <hi>Patriarcha</hi> and other of his treati≈øes he makes <hi>Adam</hi> ≈øole Monarch of the World, and that this right de≈øcended wholy and entirely to <hi>Adam</hi>'s right heir; But here we find <hi>Noah</hi> turns the Propriety and Dominion of the world into an ab≈øolute gavel-kind, and di≈øtributing the Earth among his three Sons, makes them all Heirs and Monarchs alike, ≈øo that <hi>Shem</hi> the elder is here di≈øinhereted not only of his entire Dominion in the world, but al≈øo of his natural right of Lording it over the re≈øt of his bretheren, ≈øo that whereas the whole world ≈øhould have been his, if his Father had not made this unlucky Will, he is fain to be content with a third part. I ≈øhall pa≈øs by other impo≈ø≈øibilities in this fancy of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Will, as how <hi>Noah</hi> ≈øhould by revelation make a di≈øtribution of the Earth among his Sons, when he never had di≈øcovered a hundreth part of it. <hi>Jo≈øephus,</hi> and the Fathers not ≈øuppo≈øing him ever to have de≈øcended from the Mountains of <hi>Ararat</hi> into the Plains all his life time. But to pa≈øs over ≈øuch Romantick fancies, let us come to the Authors more ≈øolid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Why Dominion, and Property could not be introduced by the voluntary con≈øent of Men, and therefore mu≈øt needs (P. 70.) have begun from <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> appointment.

For as for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch him≈øelf, it is ≈øtill ≈øuppo≈øed that he in his own per≈øon can do no injury: So that he may ≈øtill be Supreme, and yet be limited, not by any power Superior to his own, but by his laws (or declared Will) which he him≈øelf hath made in the A≈ø≈øembly of his E≈øtates, and which he can not alter, but by the ≈øame form by which they were con≈øtituted; and this ≈øort of limitation may very well con≈øi≈øt with a perfect Monarchy. Thus the King of the <hi>Medaper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øians</hi> was an ab≈øolute Monarch, and alone made laws, and yet we find in <hi>Dan.

So likewi≈øe in that ≈øame place, <hi>If in the conferring of the royal power any thing be added, by which it may be under≈øtood that the King may be compelled, or puni≈øhed: For here it is true the Soveraignty is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but the people hath it indeed altogether;</hi> For if the People have a right of puni≈øhing the King upon any pretence whatever, there is nothing conferred upon him, but the office of the fir≈øt Magi≈øtrate in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth under the name of King, but the Royal Power will ≈øtill remain in the People; becau≈øe (as I have already laid down) all puni≈øhment, <hi>quatenus</hi> as ≈øuch, mu≈øt proceed from a Superior: But all compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50833:91"/> is performed two ways, either morally, or Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that is by way of Soveraign Authority, or by force of Arms, or War; for there is no Authority can be morally ≈øuppo≈øed again≈øt an Equal, con≈øidered as ≈øuch; therefore when <hi>Grotius</hi> inferrs, that the People may be at lea≈øt equal to the King, becau≈øe in ≈øome ca≈øes it may compel him, he is likewi≈øe nece≈ø≈øitated to grant that neither of them hath any Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the other, becau≈øe it contradicts the nature of a Commonwealth: Though compul≈øion by force of Armes as between Equals, or tho≈øe who have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over each other, mu≈øt be granted in the ≈øtate of nature, in which we will make u≈øe of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s own Example; that a Creditor hath naturally a right of compelling the Debtor to pay his debts, although the Creditor hath no right to exact this of him by way of any authority thereby ve≈øted in him≈øelf: otherways it were nece≈ø≈øary that every one who owed another any thing, mu≈øt pre≈øently come under his power: therefore the Debtor mu≈øt be compelled by the Creditor to pay his debt, either by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of ≈øome Judge (which cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed between the King and People) or if they live in a natural liberty, by force. But if we ≈øhould allow this way of compul≈øion to the People, it will follow that both the King and the People do ≈øtill live in a natural liberty, or meer ≈øtate of nature; that is that the Commonwealth, is di≈ø≈øolved: Yet we will grant <hi>Grotius</hi> this, that in all civil con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there is nothing ab≈øolutely free from ≈øome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, therefore becau≈øe of the inconveniencies that ari≈øe from this divided Soveraignty, it does not pre≈øently follow that there can be no ≈øuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or that it mu≈øt pre≈øently fall to an ab≈øolute Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; for right is not to be mea≈øured from what plea≈øes either this, or that Author, but from his or their will, from whom this right at fir≈øt began. So likewi≈øe on the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50833:91"/> other ≈øide, it mu≈øt be granted that if ≈øuch divi≈øion of the Supreme Authority hath been in≈øtituted by any People that people have not con≈øtituted a Regular government but a politick body ≈øubject to perpetual di≈øtempers.</p>
               <p>Therefore ≈øuppo≈øing the mo≈øt that can be required, that the King in a limited Monarchy is he who alone gives the E≈ø≈øence and Authority to the Laws, though he can make no other than what are offered him in the A≈ø≈øembly of his E≈øtates; yet if all Magi≈øtrates that put the≈øe Laws in execution are ≈øubordinate to him, and depend upon him, this takes away that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience this Author objects again≈øt limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs: For he is truely Supreme, ≈øince he makes the laws, and is the Fountain of all power in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; neither does this derogate from the Supremacy of his Power that he is obliged either by original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or by after promi≈øe, or conde≈øcent not to make any laws, or to levy any mony, or taxes from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but what they ≈øhall offer him in the A≈ø≈øembly of his E≈øtates. For ≈øince all laws that are made in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, are but the declaration of the Monarchs will: and that he being but one man cannot declare his will Phy≈øically to the ≈øences of all his Subjects, but requires ≈øome politick form, or manner of ≈øignifying this will to all that are to obey it, which is various accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ≈øeveral Cu≈øtoms, and con≈øtitutions of divers Kingdoms; therefore as in Monarchies where there are no u≈øe of Letters, Laws can be no otherwi≈øe made, or promulgated, but by ≈øignifying the Monarchs will to the ≈øubordinate Magi≈øtrates by word of mouth, by ≈øuch Officers as mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed to bring ≈øome ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient token, that they come immediately from them, and are ≈øufficiently in≈øtructed in the matter he will have ob≈øerved as a law, which form can depend upon nothing but Cu≈øtom, or the common con≈øent of the People to admit that for Law which ≈øhall be ≈øo
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50833:92"/> promulgated, ≈øince they have no infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that the Me≈ø≈øenger may be ≈øent by ≈øome body el≈øe that hath a mind to make alterations in the State without the Princes knowledge; or el≈øe that the Me≈ø≈øenger may mi≈øtake the Princes mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and report the law wrong. So likewi≈øe in Kingdoms where laws are put into writing, there mu≈øt be ≈øome form, or rule agreed upon, both of making, and promulgating Laws: So likewi≈øe in tho≈øe we call limited Monarchies, the Cu≈øtom or form is not to admit any thing for a Law, or the authentick will of the Prince, but what his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have offered to him drawn up into form, and which he hath pa≈ø≈øed into a Law, by ≈øome token of con≈øent before in≈øtituted in the pre≈øence of the general A≈ø≈øembly of the E≈øtates of his Kingdom: which cour≈øe is ab≈øolutely the be≈øt both for the Prince and People; For ≈øince the end of all laws (as of Government it ≈øelf) are the good of the people; ≈øo it is not likely that the Subjects having the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Laws, will offer any to the Prince that they are not ab≈øolutely per≈øwaded are for the benefit of the Commonwealth, nor can that be any prejudice to the Prince's power, ≈øince no law can be made unle≈øs he give it the ≈øtamp of his Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Therefore though Forms are not e≈ø≈øential to the declareing of the will of a private man in the ≈øtate of nature, yet they mu≈øt be in re≈øpect of that of ≈øuch a Prince, ≈øince the power of the former is natural and can influence only tho≈øe that hear him, but that of a Prince is artificial, or political as proceeding from compact, and is to command even tho≈øe that never ≈øaw him, or are like to come into his pre≈øence; it is requi≈øite that the ways of declaring his will be made ≈øo certain, that the Subjects may have no rea≈øon to doubt of it: therefore there can no way
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50833:92"/> be found out which can more certainly a≈ø≈øure all the Subjects both of the benefit, and Authority of the Laws, than when a Prince voluntarily in a general A≈ø≈øembly of all the E≈øtates of his Kingdom, either by pronouncing of words, or by touching the Bills offered him with his royal Scepter, (or any ≈øuch like Ceremony) declares he will have tho≈øe Bills, or Writings promulgated and ob≈øerved as his Laws, or declared Will, which being once done in ≈øuch a ≈øolemn and publick manner, takes away all ≈øu≈øpition that the Prince was not well advi≈øed when he made them, or wrought upon by the flateries or in≈øinuations of Women or Favourites; Circum≈øtances which being wanting in ab≈øolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, where the Prince's Edicts are perhaps either given out in ha≈øt, or at ≈øecond hand to tho≈øe who never ≈øee him, by <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> or Officers; who taking the Monarch at ≈øome advantage, and makes him pa≈øs Commands which perhaps he does not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or repents of the next day; whereas in ≈øuch a limited Monarchy, a Prince does not only appear with greater Splendor and Authority, when in the face of his Subjects he exerci≈øes the highe≈øt Act of Soveraignty in making laws, but likewi≈øe a≈ø≈øures them that he acts with an ab≈øolute freedom, when having a liberty to deny, he yet grants the de≈øires of his Subjects; yet ≈øo e≈øtabli≈øhes them for Laws, that they cannot be altered without their con≈øents, and by the ≈øame means by which they were fir≈øt made: which being ≈øuppo≈øed may ≈øerve to an≈øwer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that ≈øome may make, that if this way of pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of Laws, or the Princes declaring his will after this manner be but a matter of form, or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, why may not this Monarch alter it at his plea≈øure, and declare for the future (for example) that all laws ≈øhall be by him pa≈ø≈øed in his privy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50833:93"/> Council, and then being openly proclamed, and Copies recorded in all Courts of Ju≈øtice, ≈øhall be of the ≈øame Authority as if they had been pa≈ø≈øed in the A≈ø≈øembly of E≈øtates: To which the an≈øwer is obvious, that though it is true the Monarchs pa≈ø≈øing of Laws, whether in the great Council, or in his privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil be but a matter of form, if the Legi≈ølative power remain wholly in him≈øelf; yet ≈øince even the forms, and Circum≈øtances in doing things are ≈øuch e≈ø≈øential things without which bu≈øine≈øs cannot be done; If therefore the people made it part of their original Contract with their Prince at fir≈øt, that he ≈øhould make no laws, but what ≈øhould be of their propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing, and drawing up; and that he might refu≈øe if he plea≈øed the whole, but ≈øhould not alter any part of it: This though in its ≈øelf a matter of form, yet being at fir≈øt ≈øo agreed is indeed an original and fundamental con≈øtitution of the Government.

So <hi>Hungary,</hi> which was erected by the <hi>Huns,</hi> a ≈øtirp of the European <hi>Scythians,</hi> by which you may judge the antient form of Government was much the ≈øame as that of the <hi>Germanes.</hi> All Hi≈øtories grant that Kingdom to have been limited, and to be of the ≈øame form with that of the other Northern Nations, nay which is more, to have had a Palatine, who could hinder the King from ordaining any thing contrary to the Laws: and as for <hi>Poland,</hi> the Author cannot deny but it is limited in many things; but as he only takes notice of tho≈øe things in which the King hath power, ≈øo he omits mo≈øt of tho≈øe in which he hath none, as in rai≈øing of mony, or making laws without the con≈øent of the Diet.

But for the Election of a new King, or for the making of new Laws the whole body of the Nobility, and Clergy were to be pre≈øent and con≈øent.

In <hi>Sweden</hi> the Kings power is much the ≈øame, only the Commons have repre≈øentatives in the a≈ø≈øembly of E≈øtates, which they had not in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> But in <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> the Kings (until of Late that they became Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary) were never received or owned as Lawful, until they were Crown'd and had Sworn to ob≈øerve and maintaine the Laws of the Kingdom and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Nobility and People. But the Authour thinks he hath gotten a great advantage, <hi>becau≈øe he finds that in</hi> Poland <hi>and</hi> Denmark, <hi>the Commons have no repre≈øentatives in the A≈ø≈øembly of E≈øtates, and that therefore in ≈øome limited Monarchies the whole Community in its underived Maje≈øty do not ever convene to Ju≈øtice.</hi> Which ≈øignifie little, for the≈øe that are now the Nobility may be Heirs to tho≈øe that once had the whole propriety of the Country in their hands, when the≈øe Kingdoms were erected; and ≈øo tho the body of the People encrea≈øed, yet the ancient Nobility never admitted them into a ≈øhare of the Government. As in <hi>Venice</hi> without doubt all the Ancient Planters of tho≈øe I≈ølands had Votes in the Government, and it was then popular, though it is now re≈øtrained to the ancient Families, or tho≈øe new ones they now admit, and is much ≈øuch an other cavil as that in <hi>England:</hi> Before the reduceing the <hi>Nobiles Minores</hi> to two Knights of the Shire, the Commons had no Votes in the great Council, or Parliament, which opinion ≈øee confuted in Mr. <hi>Petyt's</hi> Treati≈øe of the ancient Rights of the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in the learned Treati≈øe, call'd <hi>Jani Anglorum

As for the Original of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Government, it is evident out of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and other Authours, that the Ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> from whom our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ance≈øtors de≈øcended, and of which Nation they were a part, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew what belonged to an ab≈øolute de≈øpotick power in their Princes. And after the <hi>Saxons</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> having been erected in this I≈øland, the Ancient form of Government was not altered, as I ≈øhall prove by and by; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Monki≈øh Writers of tho≈øe times, have been ≈øhort and ob≈øcure, in that which is mo≈øt material in a Hi≈øtory, <hi>viz.</hi> the form of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and manner of ≈øucce≈ø≈øion to the Crown among≈øt them; ≈øtuffing up their books with unnece≈ø≈øary ≈øtories

Let us therefore look back to his Patriarcha, where he gives us a di≈øtinction of the School-men,<q rend="inline">'whereby they ≈øubject Kings to the directive, but not to the coactive power of Laws, and is a confe≈ø≈øion that Kings are not bound by the po≈øitive Laws of any Nation: Since the compul≈øory power of Laws of that which properly makes Laws to be Laws, by binding men by rewards and puni≈øhments to obedience; whereas the direction of the Law, is but like the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and direction which the Kings Councel gives the King, which no man ≈øays is a Law to the King.</q> Igrant this di≈øtinction, provided the Author will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe admit another, that though the King is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by Laws, or to any Judges of them as to Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; or as to the compul≈øory Power of them: Yet in re≈øpect of God, and his own Con≈øcience, he is ≈øtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ob≈øerve them, and not to di≈øpence with them in tho≈øe ca≈øes which the Law does not give him a power ≈øo to do; and ≈øince it is true that it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puni≈øhments annext that give laws their Sanction, therefore there are certain rewards which will naturally ble≈øs Princes that keep their Laws, ≈øuch as peace of Con≈øcience, Security, the affections of their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50833:102"/> People <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if I call the contrary effects to the≈øe natural puni≈øhments, that are commonly the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the breach of them, I think I ≈øhould not ≈øpeak ab≈øurdly; ≈øince the Author him≈øelf tells us <hi>P.</hi> 93. <hi>Albeit Kings who make the Laws, are (as King</hi> James <hi>there teacheth us) above Laws, yet will they rule their Subjects by the Law, and a King governing in a ≈øetled Kingdom leaves to be a King &amp; degenerates into a Tyrant ≈øo ≈øoon as he ≈øeems to rule</hi> (it is there printed in the Copy <hi>according,</hi> which is non≈øence) <hi>contrary to his Laws:</hi> and certainly a Tyrant can never promi≈øe him≈øelf ≈øecurity, either from his own Con≈øcience, or from Men; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ≈øays the direction of the Law is only like the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which the Kings Councel gives him, which no man ≈øays is a Law to him, is fal≈øe; for the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel ≈øhould never advi≈øe him to do that which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not whith a ≈øafe Con≈øcience perform; but the Kings Con≈øcience can never advi≈øe him to break tho≈øe Laws that are the boundaries between his Prerogatives, and the Peoples ju≈øt Rights; and therefore though it is true in ≈øome ca≈øes where the King ≈øees the Law ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, or doubtful, he may mitigate or interpret the Execution thereof by his Judges, to whom he hath made over that power in the intervalls of Parliament, and though perhaps ≈øome particular Statutes may be his Authority be ≈øu≈øpended, for cau≈øes be≈øt known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf and Council; Yet this does not extend to Laws of publick concernment: and for that I will appeal to the Con≈øcience of any true Son of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whether he thinks (for Example) that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for indulgence contrary to the Statute made again≈øt Conventicles were binding or no: Neither is this that follows con≈øi≈øtent with what the Author hath ≈øaid before: <hi>That although a King do frame all his Actions to be according to the Laws, yet he is not bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to but at his good will, and for good Example, or ≈øo far forth as the general Law of the ≈øafety of the Commonwealth doth naturally bind him; For in ≈øuch ≈øort only po≈øitive Laws may
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50833:102"/> may be ≈øaid to bind the King, not by being po≈øitive, but as they are naturally the be≈øt, and only means for the pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Common-wealth!</hi> So that if a King thinks any, the firme≈øt and mo≈øt indi≈øpen≈øible Laws that have been made, (≈øuppo≈øe, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the Statute <hi>de Tallagio non concedendo</hi> for example) not to be for the ≈øafety of the Commonweal, it is but his declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he will have them no longer ob≈øerved, and the work is done, nor will this that follows help it, though true, <hi>that all Kings even Tyrants and Conquerors are bound to pre≈øerve the Lands, Goods, Liberties and lives of all their Subjects, not by any Municipal Laws ≈øo much as the natural Law of a Father, which binds them to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Acts of their Fore-Fathers, and Predece≈ø≈øors in things nece≈ø≈øary for the publick Good of the Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which is very well, but if this Monarch thus ≈øucceeding in the place of the natural Father, is the ≈øole Judge of what things are nece≈ø≈øary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, what if he have a mind to keep the≈øe Children (for Children, and ≈øubjects, ≈ølaves are all one with this Authour) as ≈øome unnatural Fathers do, as cheap as they can, or to make the mo≈øt of them, will let them enjoy no more but the ≈øcanty nece≈ø≈øaries of life; and will think fair water, brown bread and wooden ≈øhooes ≈øufficient for a Farmer, and 300 <hi>l.</hi> or 400 <hi>l. per annum</hi> enough in Con≈øcience for a Country Gentleman, or de≈øiring to be ab≈øolute, (and therefore to have a con≈øtant ≈øtanding Army to rai≈øe mony with) as ≈øome Monarchs do, and being re≈øolved that for the future all the ju≈øt rights and priviledges of his Clergy Nobility and People ≈øhall ≈øignifie nothing, will take all the over-plus of his Childrens E≈øtates, eaving them no more then a poor and mi≈øerable ≈øub≈øi≈øtence, he may lawfully do what he will with his own, and it is all his upon the fir≈øt intimation of his plea≈øure by Edict, or Proclamation: But perhaps ≈øome hone≈øt Divine may ≈øtart up and tell him he will be damned for thus abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing his power, or breaking his Coronation Oath: what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50833:103"/> What if this Father of his people ≈øhall laugh at him for a fool, and think him≈øelf too cunning to believe any ≈øuch thing, or what if his Son, or Succe≈ø≈øor be re≈øolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to run his head any more into the ≈ønare of a Coronation Oath, but finding him≈øelf inve≈øted in all the ab≈øolute power of his Predece≈ø≈øour without any unju≈øt act of his own (≈øince we know Princes ≈øeldome loo≈øe any thing they have once got) will exerci≈øe it as he plea≈øes for his own humour or glory, and thinks him≈øelf not obliged in Con≈øcience to re≈øtore any of tho≈øe rights his Predece≈ø≈øor hath ur≈øuped upon his People.

               <p>But I come now to the la≈øt main Objection which the Author makes again≈øt limited Monarchy; and by which he hopes to prove it an ab≈øolute Monarchy: I will ≈øet down the difference between our Author, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> upon whom he animadverts in their own words. <q rend="inline">'Fir≈øt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> holds that the King him≈øelf in a limited Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is not to be re≈øi≈øted or puni≈øhed any more then in ab≈øolute Monarchy, and ≈øo can doe no wrong in his own per≈øon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Yet if he this limited Monarch tran≈øcends his bounds, if he commands again≈øt Law, the ≈øubject is not Legally bound to obedience in ≈øuch ca≈øes, whereupon our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor asks who ≈øhall be Judge, whether the Monarch tran≈øcend his bounds? Mr. <hi>H.</hi> conceives that in a limited legal Monarchy, there can be no ≈øtated external Judge of the Monarch's actions, if there grow a fundamental variance betwixt him, and the Community. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place confe≈ø≈øes that there can be no Judge Legal, and con≈øtituted within that form of Government, whereupon the Author thinks he hath got a great advantage over our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and therefore is re≈øolved to put the que≈øtion home, and demands of him if there be a variance betwixt the Monarch, and any of the meane≈øt per≈øons of the community who ≈øhall be judg? for in≈øtance, the King commands or gives Judgment again≈øt me: I reply his commands are illegal, and his Judgments not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law: who mu≈øt judge? if the Monarch him≈øelf judge, then you de≈øtroy the frame of the Government, and make it ab≈øolute: For ≈øaith Mr <hi>H.</hi> to confine a Monarch to a Law, and then to make him Judge of his own deviations
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50833:105"/> from that Law, is to ob≈øolve him from all Law, and on the other ≈øide, if any or all the People may Judg, then you put the Soveraignty in the whole Body, or part of it, and de≈øtroy the Being of Monarchy, and thus this Author (≈øays Sir <hi>R. A.</hi>) hath caught him≈øelf in a plain Dilemma: if the King be Judg, then he is no limited Monarch, if the people Judg, then he is no Monarch at all: ≈øo farewell limited Monarchy, nay farewell all Government if there be no Judg.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But as ≈øure as this Author thinks he hath his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øary at an Advantage, <hi>yet I do not ≈øee that he hath given him ≈øo much as a Foyl, much le≈øs a fair Fall,</hi> for all this terrible Dilemma. For fir≈øt, it is for this, that if the people be Judg when the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are unlawful, it will therefore de≈øtroy the being of Monarchy; ≈øuppo≈øe a King ≈øhould command all his Subjects to go to Ma≈øs, which they being Prote≈øtants judg Idolatrous. If they obey him, they mu≈øt commit Idolatry, if they di≈øobey him he is then no Monarch. But perhaps it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that it is true, the Subjects may judg when the Command is unlawful, but if they cannot yield active obedience, yet they mu≈øt yield a pa≈ø≈øive one, and ≈øubmit patiently to the Penalties he plea≈øes to lay upon them for not going. This An≈øwer will not ≈øerve turn, for the Authors Objection is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, if the people judg, (he does not ≈øay re≈øi≈øt) he is no Monarch at all: and refu≈øing to go to Ma≈øs is a judging the Princes Command unlawful. But Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> from whom this Argument is borrowed, drives it more home, (if the Authors friends will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Con≈øequence) &amp; affirms truely upon his own principles, that if the Subject do judg in any ca≈øe whatever, of what is lawful or unlawful, good or evil, it quite de≈øtroys the Monarchy. For the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50833:106"/> is ≈øole Judg of all Actions, whether they be Law≈øul or not. Now when the Monarch hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Will, that all his Subjects ≈øhould go to Ma≈øs, ≈øurely not to go, is to di≈øobey the Monarchs Command. Since his will was, they ≈øhould ab≈øolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go to Ma≈øs, nor leave it to their di≈øcretion either to go to Ma≈øs, or undergo the Penalty ordained for not going. La≈øtly, neither does the Judgment of the people concerning their own ≈øafty, in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, take away the ab≈øolute power of a Monarch. For a General of an Army hath an ab≈øolute Power over the Lives of his Soldiers but does it derogate from his ab≈øolute power, that he knowes he ≈øhall not be obeyed if he command his Men to leap down a Precipice, or to kill each other?</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> propo≈øes two or three expedients to help this inconvenience of the want of a publick Judg. Fir≈øt. He ≈øays a Subject is bound to yield to a Magi≈øtrate, where he cannot <hi>de jure</hi> challeng obedience, if it be in a thing in which he can po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly do it without ≈øubver≈øion to the Goverment, and in which his Act may not be made a leading Ca≈øe, and ≈øo bring on a pre≈øcription again≈øt public liberty. And again, he ≈øaith, If the Act in which the Exorbitance, or Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of the Monarch is ≈øuppo≈øed to be, be of le≈ø≈øer moment, and not ≈øtriking at the very Being of the Government, it ought to be borne by publick patience,</q> rather then to endanger the Being of the State.

                  <q rend="inline">'For he will have them to be but Fig-leaves to cover the nakedne≈øs of Mr. H's limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch formed upon weak ≈øuppo≈øals in ca≈øes of le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer moment. For if the Monarch be to govern only according to Law, no tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of his
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50833:106"/> can be of no ≈ømall moment, if he break the bounds of Law; for it is a ≈øubver≈øion of the Government it ≈øelf, and may be a leading ca≈øe, and ≈øo bring on a pre≈øcription again≈øt publick Liberty; and ≈øtrikes at the very being of the Government it ≈øelf; and let the ca≈øe be never ≈øo ≈ømall, yet if there be ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality in the Act, it ≈øtrikes at the very being of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy, which is to be legal, unle≈øs the Author will ≈øay, as in effect he doth, that his limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Monarch mu≈øt govern according to Law, in great &amp; publick matters only, but that in ≈ømaller, and which concern private Men, he may rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All which, although it look fine, yet examined to the bottom ≈øignifies little, for it is not true, that every the lea≈øt tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of the bounds of Law, is a ≈øubver≈øion of the Government it ≈øelf, ≈øince if done perhaps only to one or a few per≈øons, it does not follow that therefore it mu≈øt be a leading ca≈øe, and ≈øo bring on a pre≈øcription again≈øt publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in all ca≈øes. Neither does the Subjects bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it not contribute otherwi≈øe then acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to this breach of Liberty. Since he is obliged to bear it, not becau≈øe it is ju≈øt, but becau≈øe he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may hope to have redre≈øs by the ordinary cour≈øe of Law, or el≈øe by petitioning the A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of E≈øtates, when they meet, who are partly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained on purpo≈øe to remon≈øtrate the Grievances of Subjects to their Prince, and thereupon, to have them redre≈ø≈øed. Nor is this limited Monarch (as the Author would infer) le≈øs obliged to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, in ≈ømaller or private matters, then in great and publick ones. Only in many ≈ømaller matters, Princes or their Officers may through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or inadvertency ≈øometimes tran≈øgre≈øs the true bounds of Law, which they would not do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50833:107"/> if they were better informed. And ≈øo likewi≈øe if the Subject bear it, it is not from the Legality of the Act, but from this great Maxime in Law and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that a mi≈øchief to ≈øome private men, is better than an inconvenience in giving every private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon power, that thinks him≈øelf injured by the Prince or his Officers, to be his own Judg and right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf by force; ≈øince that were contrary to the great duty of every good Subject of endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the common peace and happine≈øs of his Country, which ought to be preferred before any private mans Intere≈øt. So on the other ≈øide if the oppre≈ø≈øion or breach of Laws be general, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all the People alike: if the rea≈øon of the ca≈øe alter, why may not the practicedo ≈øo too. <q rend="inline">'But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives us another remedy in this ca≈øe; that if the Monarchs Act of Exorbitancy or Tran≈øgre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion be mortal, and ≈øuch as ≈øuffered, di≈ø≈øolves the Frame of the Government and publick Liberty, then the illegality is to be laid open, and redre≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øought by Petition. Which is true, for an Appeal to the Law from the violence of ≈øubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Mini≈øters, is really a Petition for Ju≈øtice to the King him≈øelf, who is by the Law ≈øuppo≈øed pre≈øent in the per≈øons of his Judges that repre≈øent him: and this the Author him≈øelf in a better humour does confe≈øs in his <hi>Patriarcha</hi> P. 93.

               <p>Then our Author is angry that Mr. <hi>H. will have an Appeal made to the Con≈øciences of all Mankind, that being made, that the Fundamental Laws mu≈øt judg and pronounce Sentence in every mans own Con≈øcience, here he would fain learn of Mr. H. or any other for him, what a Fundamental Law is, or el≈øe have but one Law named to him, that any Man ≈øhall ≈øay is a Fundamental Law of the Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, to do the Authors Friends a plea≈øure, (≈øince he is dead him≈øelf) I will name one that he him≈øelf would deny to be one in this Monarchy; and that is, that the Crown upon the death of the King ≈øhould de≈øcend to the next Heir, and ≈øo we have one Fundamental Law, and I hope there may be more. But he ≈øays Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tells us, <q rend="inline">'that the Common Laws are the Foundation, and the Statute Laws ≈øuper≈øtructive.</q> Yet our Author thinks that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> dares ≈øay, <q rend="inline">'that there is any one branch or part of the Common Law, but may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Act of Parliament; for many points of the Common-Law <hi>(de facto)</hi> have, and <hi>(de jure)</hi> any point may be taken away. How can that be called a Fundamental, which hath and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and yet the Statute Laws ≈øtand firm and Stable! It is contrary to the Nature of a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, for the Building to ≈øtand, when the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is taken away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All which, is mere wrangling about the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of a Foundation and a Super≈øtructure, as if ≈øuch expre≈ø≈øions required an ab≈øolute Phy≈øical Truth as they do in the things from which they are taken.</p>
               <p>It is already granted, that all Laws in a limited Government, but tho≈øe of Nature, and right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon

               <p>I will not affirm, but the people of this Nation may give away their pre≈øent Rights of not having any Laws made, or Taxes impo≈øed upon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their con≈øent, or of not being perpetually kept in Pri≈øon or put to death without legal Trial.</p>
               <p>But the≈øe being altered, it would cea≈øe to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and turn to an ab≈øolute Monarchy, and all Statutes concerning any of the≈øe would be ≈øo far Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtructives, as to ≈øignify nothing when the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are taken away, and indeed how any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law made by Parliament could ≈øignify any thing when the Parliament is gone, I know not, ≈øince all Laws after that would depend upon the ≈øole will of the Monarch.</p>
               <p>His ≈øecond Rea≈øon is, <q rend="inline">'That the Common-Law is generally acknowledged to be nothing el≈øe but common U≈øage or Cu≈øtome, which by length of time only obtains Authority: ≈øo that it follows in time after Government, but cannot go before it, or be the Rule of Government by any Original Radical Con≈øtitution.</q>

               <p>Which is not true, as the Author hath laid it down; for all the parts of the Common-Law do not depend upon meer Cu≈øtome or U≈øage taken up after the Government in≈øtituted: and therefore his con≈øequence that follows from this is fal≈øe.

Why Rules of Play may not be made as well after the Game≈øters are in at Play, as when they fir≈øt began; and may not be as well called Fundamental Laws of the Game; ≈øince if they are not ob≈øerved, it may be lawful for any of the Game≈øters to fling up his Cards, and play no more, though he be at play with (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Natural Monarch) his own Father.</p>
               <p>But our Author will not leave off ≈øo, but mu≈øt give us one ≈øtabing Paragraph more again≈øt Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws, which is thus, <q rend="inline">'<hi>Truely the Con≈øcience of all Mankind is a pretty large Tribunal,</hi> for the≈øe Fundamental Laws to pronounce Sentence in. It is very much that Laws which in their own Nature are dumb and always need a Judg to pronounce Sentence, ≈øhould now be able to ≈øpeak, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Sentence them≈øelves: Such a Sentence ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mu≈øt be upon the hearing of one Party only; for it is impo≈ø≈øible for a Monarch to make his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and An≈øwer, and produce his Witne≈ø≈øes: in every Mans Con≈øcience in each Mans Cau≈øe; who will but que≈øtion the Legality of the Monarchs Government.

               <p>The fir≈øt Sentence of this Paragraph is An≈øwered ≈øufficiently in the Ob≈øervation upon the la≈øt Rea≈øon; but one. As for Written Laws, every Body knows they are adumb Letter; as they lie in Ink &amp; Paper, but as they come to be from thence Copied out and fixed in Mens Memories they are not dumb, neither always needs

But as for the Monarch, it is ≈øuppo≈øed that he hath already made his Defence by his Atturney, and produced his Witne≈ø≈øes when the Subject Petitioned his Judges to right him in what he conceived to be an Oppre≈ø≈øion. So that the <hi>Sentence cannot be unju≈øt, where but one Mans Tale is heard.</hi> But if the Judges in this Ca≈øe (as in that of Ship-Money) cannot convince the Plantiff, but that he is oppre≈ø≈øed contrary to Law. It is neither his nor their Judgment that can alter the Ca≈øe: But if he can have no other remedy, he mu≈øt even go home and expect better opportunities of being righted, as when there are hone≈øter Judges; or the calling of a Parliament, one of who≈øe ends is to redre≈øs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of that kind by repre≈øenting to the King the faults and tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions of his Mini≈øters, who only are puni≈øhable, and an≈øwerable for the inju≈øtice; ≈øince the King in his own Per≈øon can do none (as I have often affirmed) as for Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s conclu≈øion, that every man mu≈øt oppo≈øe or not oppo≈øe the Monarch, acoording to his own Con≈øcience, when he can have no other redre≈øs, I do not approve of it. For I will not ≈øuppo≈øe any time (in which this Nation is not oppre≈øed by a ≈øtanding Army, or Men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Principles in Religion and Goverment;) but the Subject may find redre≈øs, if not at one time, yet at another. But the other part of the di≈øpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Author and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> whether this Power
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50833:117"/> of every Mans judging of the illegal Acts of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <q rend="inline">'argues not a Superiority of tho≈øe who Judg, over him who is Judged,</q> becau≈øe it is not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and Civil, but Moral re≈øiding in Rea≈øonable Creatures, and lawful for them to execute, which is not ≈øo hard to under≈øtand as the Author makes it, if we take this Word <hi>Moral</hi> (as it is plain Mr. <hi>H.</hi> u≈øes it) in contradiction to Civil Power, which is ≈øuch a right of acting as every private Man hath, though he hath no Civil Authority. For a Mans bare judging of the ju≈øtice and inju≈øtice of all Actions that concern him, or any other man, are in≈øeparable from the Nature of Man? whether they are ordered by a Prince, or private Man; and a Princes commanding this or that to be done, or giving his judgment this way, or that way, cannot alter the≈øe ≈øettled Rules whereby Men judg of right and wrong. So that if this Author or his Friends will make u≈øe of Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Arguments of the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity of the Judgment of one Man in all Points what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they mu≈øt likewi≈øe take what follows, that there is likewi≈øe no good, or evil, or right, or wrong in the ≈øtate of Nature, but what the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch judges to be ≈øo; and when that is done, if the Authors Friends have any Religion, let them ≈øee what they will get by it; but the Author ≈øuppo≈øes he hath ≈øufficient advantage over Mr: <hi>H.</hi> becau≈øe he hath laid it down in the Page before going; <q rend="inline">'That re≈øi≈øtance ought to be made, and every Man mu≈øt oppo≈øe, or not oppo≈øe, according as in Con≈øcience he can acquit, or condemn the Acts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.

As to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> I ≈øhall only add, that the Defence which the Nobility and People made of their Antient Rights was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or declared Rebellion, either by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or any other Statute; but on the contrary, the breakers thereof were declared <hi>ip≈øo facto,</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the ≈øolemn form of which (and where the King him≈øelf who had ≈øo often broke his Oath bore a part) ≈øee in <hi>Mat. Paris.</hi> Anno 125. But to return to our Author (from whom I have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle degre≈ø≈øed) I think he is mi≈øtaken in affirming all Power which enables in ≈øome ca≈øes a Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt or oppo≈øe his Governors, mu≈øt be Authoritative and Civil: Therefore I ≈øhall put the ≈øame ca≈øe again which I did about the beginning of the≈øe Ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the Natural Power of Fathers: Suppo≈øe a Son cannot otherwi≈øe pre≈øerve his own Life, or that of his Mother, or Brothers from the rage of his mad or drunken Father; but by holding him, or binding him, if need be; I ≈øuppo≈øe no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable Man will deny the lawfullne≈øs of this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet this Power over his Fathers Per≈øon is not Authoritative, or Civil, but Moral, and which the Son does exerci≈øe not as Superior to his Father, but as a Rational Creature obliged by the Laws of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50833:118"/> Nature, to pre≈øerve his own being, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the good pre≈øervation of his Parents and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not again≈øt Paternal Authority (which is always Rational, and for the good of the Family) but Bruti≈øh, Irrational force: Which God gives every Man a right to judg of; ≈øo likewi≈øe if a Prince prove either a Madman, or a ≈øtark Fool, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which their Subjects exerci≈øe in the ordering him, or confining him, and appointing Regents, or Protectors to Govern for him, and in his Name, is not Authoritative, or Civil, ≈øince the Prince him≈øelf who is the Fountain of all Authority, gave them no ≈øuch power, and therefore mu≈øt be Natural, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or re≈øiding in them as rea≈øonable Creatures. And of this we have had divers examples. Thus the <hi>French</hi> were forced to confine their Mad King <hi>Charles</hi> VI. and appoint his Queen to be Regent during his Di≈øtraction. So likewi≈øe <hi>Joan</hi> Queen of <hi>Ca≈øtile,</hi> falling Di≈øtracted upon the Death of Her Husband King <hi>Philip</hi> I. Her Father <hi>Ferdinand</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in Her right; and after His decea≈øe, Her Son <hi>Charles</hi> afterwards Emperor (≈øhe continuing bereft of her under≈øtanding) was admitted King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtile.</hi> And what hath been done lately in <hi>Portugal,</hi> is ≈øo notorious, that it needs not a particular Recital. So then Mr. <hi>Hs.</hi> expre≈ø≈øion, That this is a Moral Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, re≈øiding in rea≈øonable Creatures, and lawful for them to execute, may not ≈øeem ≈øo ab≈øurd as to imply what our Author endeavours to draw from <hi>thence, that Authoritative,</hi> and Civil <hi>Judgment does not</hi> re≈øide in <hi>rea≈øonable Creatures,</hi> nor can <hi>be Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> executed: ≈øince a Rea≈øonable Creature may be endued with another Power of acting precedent to that of the Civil.</p>
               <p>So I ≈øhall likewi≈øe leave it to the Judgment of the impartial Reader, whether this conclu≈øion fits
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50833:119"/> ≈øo well with Anarchy as the Author will have it. As al≈øo whether Mr. <hi>H.</hi> take away all Government by leaving every Man to his own Con≈øcience to judg when the Prince oppre≈ø≈øes him; for el≈øe how could he ≈øue for relief to the Prince him≈øelf; and ≈øo all actions a Prince did, or commanded would be ju≈øt, and lawful though never ≈øo contrary to Rea≈øon, or po≈øitive Law. And ≈øo there would be truly (as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> a≈ø≈øerts) no other mea≈øure of good, and evil, right or wrong but the Princes will.</p>
               <p>But as I have no where maintained with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his Treati≈øe, which our Author writes again≈øt, that ours is a mixt Monarchy though limited by Law; and therefore ≈øhall not maintain as he does the King to be one of the Three E≈øtates (according to the Opinions held during the late Wars. So on the other ≈øide, that there is, and ever hath been ≈øuch a Government as a mixt Monarchy in ≈øome Countreys, I hope I have made out (notwith≈øtanding what this Author ≈øays to the contrary: and that the≈øe might more properly be called a mixt Monarchy, then mixt Ari≈øtocracy, or mixt Democracy. Since all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this kind, take their denomination from the mo≈øt Honourable and Predominant part in it, in whom the Executive or Authoritative part re≈øides.</p>
               <p>And though perhaps ≈øome of the≈øe Governments may not ≈øeem ≈øo firm, ≈øo regular, and well con≈øtituted as others, it does not therefore follow that they are meer Anarchies, or that all mixtures, and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Monarchy are vain, or unlawful as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor imagines.</p>
               <p>For a further proof of which, I will not give you may own ≈øence alone, but likewi≈øe of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Civil Lawyer Mr. <hi>Pufendorf</hi> now or very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gretian Profe≈ø≈øor in the Univer≈øity of <hi>

But in the next Chapter of the ≈øame Book, the ≈øame Author ≈øpeaking of the rights of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power; where when he hath fir≈øt proved, what it is that makes any Power be called Supreme in a Common-wealth, and that he who hath this Power mu≈øt be free from puni≈øhment, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to humane Laws; and that he hath confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Long Parliaments di≈øtinction of a real and Per≈øonal Maje≈øty, and that Kings properly ≈øo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mu≈øt be Superior to all the People; and having an≈øwered the Objections to the contrary, at la≈øt he proceeds ¬ß 7 to ≈øhew what ab≈øolute Power is, and that it is not found alike in all Forms of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and gives us the true Original of limited Governments; his ≈øence is ≈øo good, that I ≈øhall not much contract what he ≈øays, but give it you as it is, ¬ß 7. 8, 9, 10. Be≈øides it is apparent enough, that in ≈øome Common-wealths the Royal Authority is free in the exerci≈øe of its Acts, but re≈øtrained to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mode of acting, from whence aro≈øe the di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Empire into limited, and ab≈øolute, where in the fir≈øt place it is to be explained, what is meant by the word ab≈øolute, which is ≈øo odious to tho≈øe who have had their Education in free Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. Indeed the ≈øame word being ill interpreted, may incite ≈øome Princes to vex their Subjects, and to commit a great deal of wickedne≈øs. Flatterers adding fuel to the Fire, who are ≈øtill ready to encourage the Ambition, and other Vices of their Prince at this rate. Sir, you are ab≈øolute, therefore if it plea≈øes you, it is lawful: therefore you may tire out your own Subjects, and all your Neighbours with unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary Wars, that you may appear a mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and ≈øet forth your own Glory; therefore you may affront, and in≈øult over whom you plea≈øe, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50833:121"/> drain your Subjects with all ≈øorts of Exactions, that you may have wherewith to ≈øerve your Luxury, or Ambition; according to the Flattery of <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> upon the death of <hi>Clitus,</hi> that right and wrong, <note place="margin">Plutarch. <hi>ad Princi. indoct.</hi>
                  </note> do ≈øit by <hi>Jupiter;</hi> that what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the King does, ought to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right, and ju≈øt ≈øo that there are ≈øome who go about to e≈øtabli≈øh the ab≈øolute right of Kings by Arguments, that ≈øeem to have no other Mea≈øure thereof, then impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and a Licen≈øe to vex their People. Therefore as by an ab≈øolute Liberty of particular Men is meant, their judging of their own affairs and actions, according to their own, and not anothers judgment: yet ≈øtill ≈øuppo≈øing their Obligation to the Laws of Nature, And that this Liberty belongs to all Men, who are not as yet ≈øubject to anothers will: ≈øo where divers Men have United together into a perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it is nece≈ø≈øary for the ≈øame liberty or facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of appointing, re≈øolving all means nece≈ø≈øary for their own ≈øafety, ≈øhould now exi≈øt in the Supreme Power, as in a common Subject: which Liberty is accompanied with the Highe≈øt Authority, or a right of pre≈øcribing tho≈øe means to the Subjects, and of compelling them to their Duty; therefore in every Commonwealth properly ≈øo called, there mu≈øt be an ab≈øolute Power at lea≈øt habitual, though not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed, for it mu≈øt be an≈øwerable to Superior, and to have a right of Judging of its own affairs by its own Judgment and will. Therefore that ab≈øolute Power implies nothing in its ≈øelf unju≈øt, or intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is ea≈øie to be perceived from the ends of in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of Commonwealths. For indeed we never con≈øtituted them, that neglecting Natural right, things ≈øhould be done out of a wicked, and perver≈øe Lu≈øt or Humour; but that the ≈øecurity and ≈øafety of ≈øingulars may be more conveniently looked after by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50833:121"/> the joint a≈ø≈øi≈øtances of many. So that they might more ≈øafely and with more lea≈øure live after the Laws of Nature, and Virtue.</p>
               <p>Yet when this Supreme Authority is con≈øidered as it is conferred upon one Man, or one Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting of all, or few, as in its proper ≈øubject, it is not always free, and ab≈øolute, but in ≈øome places limited by certain laws; indeed in <hi>Democracies</hi> the difference between ab≈øolute, and limited Power ≈øeems not ≈øo ea≈øie to be ob≈øerved, for although in every Democracy there mu≈øt needs continue certain In≈øtitutions received by u≈øe, or e≈øtabli≈øht by written Laws, at what time, and by whom the People ≈øhould be A≈ø≈øembled, and Publick bu≈øine≈øs propo≈øed, and Executed, ≈øince without ≈øuch things, a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth cannot be under≈øtood, yet ≈øince that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil con≈øi≈øts of all the Citizens, in whom the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority re≈øides; nothing can hinder, but tho≈øe Con≈øtitutions may be altered or abrogated at any time by the ≈øame People that made them.</p>
               <p>But in Ari≈øtocracies and Monarchies, where there are ≈øome who command, and others who obey, and ≈øo a Right ari≈øes to the≈øe from the Promi≈øes and Commands of the other. There does plainly appear a difference between an ab≈øolute and limited power, he is therefore ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute who exerci≈øes his Authority according to his own di≈øcretion, and not according to the Rule of any certain, or perpetual Con≈øtitutions; but as the pre≈øent condition of affairs require, and who does ≈øo provide for the ≈øafety of the Common-wealth, as its occa≈øions direct him: from whence the word ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute is ≈øo far from implying any thing unju≈øt or hateful in it ≈øelf, or intolerable for Free-men; that it ≈øhould rather lay upon ≈øuch ab≈øolute Princes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of greater care and circum≈øpection, if they
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50833:122"/> will acquit them≈øelves of their Duty, and di≈øcharge their Con≈øciences as they ought; then on tho≈øe to whom a certain form of di≈øpatching publick Affairs is pre≈øcribed. So <hi>Dio Chry≈øo≈øt. Orati.</hi> 62. de≈øcribes an ab≈øolute Prince thus, <q rend="inline">"a good Prince covets nothing becau≈øe he ≈øuppo≈øes him≈øelf to po≈ø≈øe≈øs all things, he ab≈øtains from plea≈øures, ≈øince he may enjoy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever he plea≈øes. He is ju≈øter than others, as he who is to be an example of Ju≈øtice to others. He takes plea≈øure in bu≈øine≈øs, becau≈øe he labours of his own accord. He loves the Laws, becau≈øe he does not fear them; and of all the≈øe he rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwades him≈øelf: for who hath greater need of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then he who deliberates of ≈øuch great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? Who of more exact Ju≈øtice, then he who is above the Laws? Who of a more ≈øevere mode≈øty, than he to whom all things are Lawful? Who of greater Fortitude, than he who keeps all things in ≈øafety?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet becau≈øe the Judgment of any one man in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcerning that which truly conduces to the publick ≈øafety may be ea≈øily deceived, neither is there in all Men that ≈øtrength of mind, that they may know how in ≈øo great a Liberty to govern their Pa≈ø≈øions and Lu≈øts (as <hi>Herodian Li.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. well ob≈øerves) that it is difficult in the highe≈øt Liberty for a Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrain him≈øelf, &amp; as it were to bridle his own de≈øires. Therefore it ≈øeemed mo≈øt convenient to divers peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not to commit ≈øo great a power to one mans ≈øole di≈øcretion, and he no more free from Errors than others, but rather more ≈øubject to Vices; and therefore would rather pre≈øcribe the Prince a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Form or Method of di≈øpatching of publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, after it was at fir≈øt found out what ≈øort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutions, or forms of di≈øpatching publick Affairs did be≈øt ≈øuit with the Genius of the people, and the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50833:122"/> Nature of the Common-wealth to be con≈øtituted. Neither is there any injury done to the Prince, who was at fir≈øt rai≈øed to that Dignity by the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the people upon tho≈øe conditions. For if it ≈øeemed grievous to take the ≈øupreme Authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he could not manage it as he plea≈øed, he might have refu≈øed it if he would; ≈øo the Con≈øcience of the Oath by which they are obliged upon their taking this Authority ought to re≈øtrain them and their Succe≈ø≈øors from going about to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves ab≈øolute by ≈øecret Machinations and De≈øigns: Much le≈øs to ≈øubvert the Laws of the Kingdom by force. <note place="margin">Plin. Paneg.</note> 
                  <hi>Since an Oath is not more Religiou≈øly to be ob≈øerved by any than he whom it mo≈øt chiefly concerns not to be perjured.</hi> For that is too weak which ≈øome maintain, that ≈øince Kings are ordained by God, who injoyns them a true di≈øcharge of their Duty, which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the exerci≈øe of the mo≈øt ab≈øolute power: and therefore God is to be ≈øuppo≈øed to have conferred ≈øuch a proportion of power on all Kings, as that they ought not to ≈øuffer the lea≈øt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be dimini≈øhed or circum≈øcribed, and that the People can neither rightly require or oblige their King to it; no more than there can hone≈øtly be made ≈øuch a bargain between a Husband and a Wife that he ≈øhould connive at her ≈øtolen plea≈øures. But as we have already ≈øufficiently proved, that as all Civil Government is from God, yet is ≈øo left in Mans di≈øpo≈øal (at lea≈øt to tho≈øe that God did not give any particular Laws to) what ≈øort of Government they would ≈øet up (as <hi>Phil.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50833:123"/> to Right, Nature, and Rea≈øon;</hi> and as I think there is no where any Divine precept extant, that a free People being about to chu≈øe it ≈øelf a King, ≈øhould chu≈øe <hi>Cajus</hi> rather than <hi>Titius,</hi> no more is there any certain form Divinely e≈øtabli≈øh'd, under which, and no other Authority, is to be conferred on Princes. Neither are the≈øe Men any way helped by that place of 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. where ≈øome will have only the bare unju≈øt practice of Kings, that the true right of all Kings is to be there de≈øcribed. But <hi>Grotius,</hi> Lib 1. c. 4. ¬ß 3. Taking a middle way lays down, that there the bare actions of a King is de≈øcribed, yet what hath the effect of a right, to wit an Obligation of <hi>non</hi> re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance: So that however a King may act again≈øt his Duty when he commits ≈øuch things; yet that his Subject ≈øought no more to re≈øi≈øt, than if he had acted thus by the highe≈øt Right; and therefore it is added that the People pre≈ø≈øed by tho≈øe vexations ≈øhould cry to God, becau≈øe there remained no humane reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. So that this was called the Right of the King in that ≈øence as the <hi>Roman</hi> Praetor was ≈øayed, <hi>jus red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> to judg right, even then when he decreed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtly; however I conceive the true ≈øence of this place may be thus under≈øtood, there had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto a Democracy among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but that which often re≈øembled that ≈øort of Kingdome which <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> calls Heroical. The Judges incited by a divine in≈øtinct did for the mo≈øt part re≈øcue the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed People from their Enemies, or el≈øe in Peace Judged Cau≈øes: but in other matters were rather endued with a power of per≈øwading, than command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but yet their Equipage and State being ≈ømall, was not born or encrea≈øed by any Publick Taxes; yet the People weary of this Government, would have a King after the manner of other Nations: That is, who ≈øhould appear in great State, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50833:123"/> Splendour, and ≈øhould maintain a con≈øtant Guard, or at lea≈øt ≈øhould ≈øtill exerci≈øe his Subjects in Arms, that they might ≈øtill be able to meet their Enemies in the Field, ≈øee <hi>Sam.</hi> XIII. 2. XIV. 48, 52. Now <hi>Samuel,</hi> that the People might con≈øider of it ≈øoberly before hand, lays open to them the Prerogatives of ≈øuch a King: and the inconveniencies of that Government. You would have a King remarkable by a great deal of Splendour; but ≈øuch a one mu≈øt be attended with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Train, and ≈øo will take your Sons, and appoint them for him≈øelf, and to be his Hor≈øemen, and to run before his Chariots. You would have a King. who ≈øhould maintain an Army; but it <hi>will be nece≈ø≈øary that he appoint him Captains over Hundreds, and Captains over Fifties;</hi> and this mu≈øt be of your Sons, who were u≈øed before to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your own bu≈øine≈øs only; the greatne≈øs of his affairs, and the ≈øtate of his Office, will not permit this King to till his own Land; Therefore of your Sons will he ≈øet ≈øome to Ear his Ground, and Reap his Harve≈øt, and to make his In≈øtruments of War; and ≈øince be≈øides he mu≈øt need a great deal of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and that it will not become the Dignity of his Wives, or Daughters, to look after the Hou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-affairs. Therefore he will take your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be Confectioners, to be Cooks, and to be Bakers; he will likewi≈øe ≈øtand in need of many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to di≈øpatch the bu≈øine≈ø≈øes of War and Peace, and who all mu≈øt have Salaries: and therefore he will take your Fields, and your Vineyards and your Olive-Yards, and give them to your Servants: and to this purpo≈øe he will take the Tenth of your Seed, and of your Vineyards, and give to his Officers, and to his Servants, and he will likewi≈øe when he hath need, take your Men-≈øervants, and your Maid-≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and your young Men, and your A≈ø≈øes, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50833:124"/> put them to his work. In ≈øhort he ≈øays no more than this; If you will have a King, he mu≈øt be maintained like a King, and a certain Revenue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this end; of which burthen if you are afterwards a weary, you ≈øhall not be able to Depo≈øe him again, ≈øince he obtain'd the Kingdom by your choice and con≈øent, and ≈øo cannot be taken from him. So that it is plain, that this place does not at all ≈øerve to Patronize evil Princes; ≈øo neither that there is here any limited Power conferred by God after the manner of a con≈øtant and unalterable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and of which no con≈øtitutions can dimini≈øh any part; ≈øince here only the nece≈ø≈øary Charges and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as well of an ab≈øolute, as of a limited Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are de≈øcribed; therefore it is wholly in the will of a free People, whether they will have an ab≈øolute Power, or will deliver it with certain Laws, ≈øo that tho≈øe Laws contain nothing that is wicked, or which may de≈øtroy the ends of Government; for although Men at the beginning did freely enter into a civil Society, yet ≈øince they were before obliged to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of the Law of Nature, they ought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitute ≈øuch Rules of Power, and civil Obedience which might be agreeable to that Law, and to the lawful ends of all Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>But as it may rightly be under≈øtood, by what ≈øort of Promi≈øe, a Kingly Government may cea≈øe to be ab≈øolute (for every promi≈øe hath not that force) it is to be under≈øtood that a King upon his taking the Kingdom, may oblige him≈øelf either by a General, or ≈øpecial Promi≈øe, which for the mo≈øt part is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Religion of an Oath. A General Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe may be made either tacitely or expre≈øly. A tacite Promi≈øe of Governing well is under≈øtood in the very acceptance of the Kingdom, although there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing expre≈øly Promi≈øed; yet mo≈øt commonly this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50833:124"/> ought to be made expre≈øly not without an Oath, &amp; the ≈øolemnity of certain rights; neither is it unu≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that in this promi≈øe the Office of a King ≈øhould be de≈øcribed by a Periphra≈øis, or enumeration of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts; as ≈øuppo≈øe it be, that he will take care of the Publick ≈øafety; that he will defend the good, and puni≈øh the bad, that he will Admini≈øter indifferent Ju≈øtice, that he will oppre≈øs no Body, or the like. Such Promi≈ø≈øes do not all detract from ab≈øolutene≈øs of his Power. ≈øince the King is indeed obliged by tho≈øe general Promi≈øes, to govern well; but what Method, or what means he ≈øhall make u≈øe of for this end is left to his will, and di≈øcretion; but a ≈øpecial promi≈øe, and in which both the Method, and means to be u≈øed in the Admini≈øtring the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are particularly expre≈ø≈øed, ≈øeem to have a twofold Power; for one only obliges the Con≈øcience of the King; but the other makes the Obedience of the Subjects depend upon its performance, as upon an expre≈øs condition. <hi>A</hi> Promi≈øe of the fir≈øt ≈øort is thus, If the King ≈øhould ≈øwear, for example, that he will not be≈øtow any Offices of tru≈øt, on ≈øuch a ≈øort of Men, that he will not grant any Priviledges to any which ≈øhall redound to the prejudice of others, that he will make no new Laws, or impo≈øe new Taxes or Cu≈øtoms, or will not u≈øe Foreign Souldiers or the like. Yet if there be no certain Council, or A≈ø≈øembly Cou≈øtituted, which the King ≈øhould be obliged to con≈øult, whether the occa≈øions of the Common-wealth require he ≈øhould depart from tho≈øe Engagements (for there is ≈øtill in all of them, that tacite exception ≈øtill under≈øtood (unle≈øs the Safety of the Common-wealth the Supreme Law in all ≈øuch Engagements require otherwi≈øe) and which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil by its own right, and not precariou≈øly can take cognizance of tho≈øe affairs, and without who≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50833:125"/> the Subjects cannot be obliged to ob≈øerve the Kings commands in ≈øuch matters; here the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtration of the ≈øupreme Authority being re≈øtrained to certain Laws, if the King ≈øhall act otherwi≈øe (unle≈øs in ca≈øes of great nece≈ø≈øity,) he is without doubt guilty of the breach of his Oath; yet there does not therefore belong any power to the Subject to deny Obedience to the Kings commands, or of making tho≈øe actions void. For if the King do ≈øay, That the ≈øafety of the People, or ≈øome remarkable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Commonwealth requires him to break his Promi≈øe, as that pre≈øumption always ought to go along with the Kings actions, the Subjects in this ca≈øe have not any thing to reply: becau≈øe they have no faculty of taking Cognizance of tho≈øe actions, whether the nece≈ø≈øity of the Common-wealth requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them or not; from which this is apparent, that they do not take a ≈øufficient caution, if they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their King but a limited Power, and yet hath not Con≈øtituted ≈øome great Council, without who≈øe con≈øent tho≈øe actions excepted cannot be exerci≈øed, or unle≈øs there lie upon the King a nece≈ø≈øity of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the E≈øtates, whenever he deliberates upon the exerci≈øe of tho≈øe Legi≈ølative Powers, for that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than if it ≈øhould be nece≈ø≈øary for the King to con≈øult ≈øome Council, con≈øi≈øting only of ≈øome few of his Subjects: ≈øince it may ea≈øily happen that the private advantages of tho≈øe few may differ from the publick good, and likewi≈øe, they for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intere≈øt, may not agree in tho≈øe things which are truly beneficial for their Prince.</p>
               <p>But the Authority of a King is more clo≈øly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained, if it be expre≈øly agreed between the King and People upon the conferring the ≈øupreme power upon Him, or his Ance≈øtors that he ≈øhould Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter it according to certain Fundamental Laws;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50833:125"/> and concerning tho≈øe matters which he hath not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute Power to di≈øpo≈øe of, that he leave them to a great Council of the People, or Nobility, neither may decree any thing in tho≈øe matters without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent; and if they ≈øhould be done otherwi≈øe, that the Subjects would not be obliged to ob≈øerve his commands in ≈øuch things; neither, yet is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power rendred defective by ≈øuch Fundamental Con≈øtitutions. For all the acts of Supreme Power may be exerci≈øed in ≈øuch a Kingdom, as well as in an ab≈øolute one, unle≈øs that in the one, the King u≈øes his own Judgment alone, as deci≈øive, but in the other there is as it were a concomitant Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance remaining in the great Council, upon which power of the Supreme Authority it does not radically; but as it were conditionally depend, <hi>&amp; ≈øine qua non;</hi> neither are there in ≈øuch a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth two di≈øtinct wills, forall things which the Common-wealth wills, it wills them by the Kings will alone; although it might happen form that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, that certain conditions not being ob≈øerved, the King cannot legally will ≈øome things, and ≈øo wills them in vain; but neither does the King cea≈øe to have the ≈øupreme Power in ≈øuch a Kingdom; or that this Council is therefore above the King. For the≈øe are no true con≈øequences, that becau≈øe this Per≈øon cannot do all things according to his own humour, therefore he hath not ≈øupreme Power. I am not obliged to obey this Man in all things, therefore I am his Superior, or Equal: and the≈øe are likewi≈øe very different; I am bound to perform what this Man plea≈øes; becau≈øe I have obliged my ≈øelf to it by compact; and I am obliged to follow this Mans will, becau≈øe he can enjoyn me thus by his ≈øupreme Authority. But ≈øupreme, and ab≈øolute are not one, and the ≈øame thing, for that denotes the ab≈øen≈øe of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50833:126"/> a Superiour, or an Equal in the ≈øame order or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but this a faculty of exerci≈øeing any right by a Mans own Judgment and Will; but what if there be added a Commi≈ø≈øary clau≈øe; that if he ≈øhall do otherwi≈øe he ≈øhall forfeit his Kingdom; as the <hi>Arogonians</hi> of Old after the King had ≈øworn to their Priviledges, did promi≈øe him Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this manner: <note place="margin">

               <p>Here it is certain, that an ab≈øolute King cannot be He to whom the Kingdom is thus committed under a Commi≈ø≈øary Clau≈øe, or Condition: but that this King may have for all this a regal Power though li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, I ≈øee no rea≈øon to the contrary; for although we grant a Temporary Authority cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for Supreme, becau≈øe it depends upon a pote≈øtative condition, and which can never be in the Princes power. Yet a King of this ≈øort above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd is not therefore ≈øubject to the power of the People, with whom the cognizance is whether he keep his Oath, or not, for be≈øides that ≈øuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øary Clau≈øe is wont to comprehend only ≈øuch plain things, which are evident to any Mans ≈øences; and ≈øo are not liable to di≈øpute. So that this power of taking cognizance does not at all ≈øuppo≈øe any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction by which the Actions of the King as a Subject may be judged, but is nothing el≈øe, than a bare Declaration, whereby any Man takes notice that his manife≈øt right is violated by another. See <hi>Grotius,</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 3. ¬ß 16.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50833:126"/> Kings, does either fall upon the exerci≈øe of the act, or al≈øo directly upon the very power of it, if he act contrary to promi≈øes of the former ≈øort; the act may be called unju≈øt, and yet be valid; if again≈øt tho≈øe of the latter, it is al≈øo void, as if he ≈øhould have ≈øaid, Sometimes a King promi≈øes not to u≈øe part of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, but after acertain manner; and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he plainly renounces ≈øome part thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which there are two things to be ob≈øerved; fir≈øt that al≈øo ≈øome acts may be void, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed contrary to an Obligation of the former ≈øorts; as for example, if a King ≈øwear not to impo≈øe any Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without the con≈øent of the E≈øtates. I ≈øuppo≈øe that ≈øuch Taxes which the King ≈øhall Levy by his own will alone; to bevoid. Secondly, That in the latter form the parts of the ≈øupreme power, are divided.</p>
               <p>But that the Nature of limited Kingdoms may more thoroughly be under≈øtood; it is to be ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the affairs which occur in Governning a Common-wealth are of two kinds; for of ≈øome of them it may be agreed beforehand, becau≈øe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they happen they are ≈øtill but of the ≈øame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but of others, a certain Judgment cannot be made but at the time pre≈øent, whether they are beneficial to the Publick or not; for that tho≈øe circum≈øtances which accompany them, cannot be for≈øeen. Yet concerning both, that People may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that he to whom they have commited this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Kingdom ≈øhould not depart from the Common good in the former, whil≈øt it pre≈øcribes perpetual Laws or Conditions which the King ≈øhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ob≈øerve in the latter, whil≈øt he is obliged to con≈øult the a≈ø≈øembly of his People or Nobility. Thus the People being ≈øatisfied of the truth of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and what ≈øort of Eccle≈øia≈øtical Government, or Ceremonies do be≈øt ≈øuit their Genius; ≈øo it is in <hi>Sweden,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:50833:127"/> may condition with the King upon his Inauguration, that he ≈øhall not change any thing in Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by his ≈øole Authority. So every Body being ≈øen≈øible, how often Ju≈øtice would be injured, if Sentence ≈øhould always be given by the ≈øole Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prince, <hi>&amp; ex aequo &amp; hono,</hi> without any written or known Laws, and that Pa≈ø≈øion, <note place="margin">VI. <hi>Tacit An. L.</hi> 13. 4. 2.</note> Intere≈øt, or unskilfulne≈øs would have too great a ≈øway for avoiding this inconvenience, the people may oblige their King, that either he ≈øhall compo≈øe a Body of ju≈øt Laws, or ob≈øerve tho≈øe that are already extant and al≈øo that Judgment be given according to tho≈øe Laws, in certain Courts or Colledges of Ju≈øtice, and that none but the mo≈øt weighty Cau≈øes ≈øhould come before the King by way of Appeal. <note place="margin">This is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe the Law of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  </note> So likewi≈øe, ≈øince it is well known how ea≈øily Riches obtained by the Labour of others, may be ≈øquandered away by Luxury or Ambition: therefore the Subjects Goods ≈øhould not lie at their Princes mercy to ≈øu≈øtain their Lu≈øts. Some Nations have wi≈øely a≈ø≈øigned a certain Revenue to their Prince, ≈øuch as they ≈øuppo≈øed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for the con≈øtant Charges of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; but if greater expences were nece≈ø≈øary, they would have tho≈øe referred to the A≈ø≈øembly of E≈øtates. And ≈øince al≈øo ≈øome Kings are more de≈øirous than they ought to be of Military Glory, and running them≈øelves into unnece≈ø≈øary Wars, may put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves and their Kingdoms in hazard, therefore ≈øome of them have been ≈øo cautious, that in the conferring the regal Dignity, they have impo≈øed this nece≈ø≈øity upon their Kings, that if they would make offen≈øive Wars upon their Neighbours, they ≈øhould fir≈øt advi≈øe with their great Council; and ≈øo likewi≈øe it might be ordained concerning other
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50833:127"/> matters, which the People judged nece≈ø≈øary for the Common-wealth, le≈øt that if an ab≈øolute power of ordering tho≈øe things, were left to the Prince, the common good of the People would perhaps be le≈øs con≈øidered.</p>
               <p>And ≈øince the people would not leave to this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited King an ab≈øolute power in tho≈øe Acts which are thus excepted, but that an A≈ø≈øembly, either of the whole people, or of tho≈øe that repre≈øent them divided into their ≈øeveral Orders; it is further to be ob≈øerved, that the power of this Council, or A≈ø≈øembly, is not alike every where. For in ≈øome places the King him≈øelf though every where ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, may have appointed a Council, or Senate, without who≈øe approbation he will not have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to be valid. Which Senate without doubt will only have the Authority of Councellors, and though they may que≈øtion the Kings Grants or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and reject tho≈øe which they judg inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for the Common-wealth, yet they do not this by any inherent Right, but by a power granted them from the King him≈øelf. Who would this way prevent his decreeing any thing through ha≈øt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, or the per≈øwa≈øion of Flatterers that might prove hurtful to his State: to which may be referred what <hi>Plutarch</hi> mentions in his Apothegms. <q rend="inline">'That the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings ob≈øerve a Law, <note place="margin">Note the Antiquity of of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Law.</note> whereby they oblige their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by Oath, that if the King require an unju≈øt Sentence from them, they ≈øhould refu≈øe him.</q> And in the ≈øame place it is noted, that <hi>Antigonus</hi> 3. writ to his Cities, that if by his Letter he ≈øhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand anything contrary to his Laws, they ≈øhould not obey it, but ≈øhould think he failed thorough ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or mi≈øinformation; and oftentimes impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50833:128"/> Reque≈øts are cluded this way, whil≈øt the Prince ≈øeems for quietne≈øs ≈øake content to grant what he knows will be made void by this Senate or Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">As it hath been often in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> yet when the King is re≈øolved that his Will ≈øhall hold good, and looks upon the contrary Rea≈øons of this Parliament as not weighty enough to convince him, it cannot then any longer contradict the Kings Will; for it is not pre≈øumed that the King by con≈øtituting ≈øuch a Court would irrevocably abdicate his Right of ab≈øolute power. So that this Senate or Parliament hath indeed but a Derivative power from the King to be limited as he him≈øelf ≈øhall plea≈øe, although perhaps he will not exert this power but upon weighty con≈øiderations, nor does this Court make the power of the King le≈øs than ab≈øolute; ≈øince it only gives him occa≈øion to review his own Acts, and as it were Appeals from him≈øelf, when ≈øurpri≈øed with Pa≈ø≈øions Prejudices, or mi≈øinformation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf in a more indifferent and con≈øiderate Temper. The like may be ≈øaid of the A≈ø≈øembly of E≈øtates, if they meet only for this purpo≈øe that they ≈øhould be the Kings greate≈øt Council, by which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øts and complaints of his People, which often times are concealed in his private Council, may come to the Kings ears; who is then left free to Enact what he thinks expedient, <hi>Vid. Gro. Li.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. ¬ß. 10. But a Kingdom is truely limited, when the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at fir≈øt conferred it on the King, on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ≈øhould a≈ø≈øemble the E≈øtates concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ≈øome Acts, without who≈øe con≈øent this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ≈øhould not be valid, yet it ought to be in the Kings power to call, and di≈ø≈øolve this A≈ø≈øembly, and to propo≈øe the bu≈øine≈øs to be di≈øpatcht therein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs we ≈øhould go about to ≈øet up an irregular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50833:128"/> and leave the King no more than an empty Title, but if the≈øe States being ≈øo convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do of their own accord Propo≈øe tho≈øe things which they conceive conducing to the good and ≈øafety of the Kingdom, yet the Decrees or Acts con≈øtituted concerning them, take their force from the Kings pa≈ø≈øing them. Yet ≈øuch an a≈ø≈øembly of E≈øtates do differ from Coun≈øellors properly taken in this, that although both of them can only move the King by rea≈øon only, yet the King may very well reject the Rea≈øons of the≈øe latter, but not of the former, neither ought the King to think him≈øelf contemned, if the≈øe E≈øtates do not con≈øent to ≈øome things of his propo≈øing. For as he promi≈øed at fir≈øt to have always before his Eyes the good of the Common-wealth, of which a great many choice men are ≈øuppo≈øed to Judg more certainly than one. A King may mo≈øt commonly blame his own impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Pa≈ø≈øions, or ill Fortune, if the States hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to differ from him, from whence it likewi≈øe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that their fear is vain, who think that by this means, it is at the di≈øpo≈øal of the E≈øtates, whether the Common-wealth ≈øhall be ≈øafe or not. For it can ≈øcarcely be ≈øuppo≈øed, that the King ≈øhould be ≈øo negligent, as to omit laying open to his E≈øtates the nece≈ø≈øities of the Kingdom, or that the E≈øtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully ≈øatisfied of them, will ever go about to betray their own ≈øafety. But this is certain, ≈øince tho≈øe who have conferred the limited power cannot be pre≈øumed either to intend to de≈øtroy or di≈ø≈øolve the Common-wealth; or by their confederacy to order things ≈øo, that the end of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, cannot be obtained in it, therefore there ought to be that favourable interpretation made of tho≈øe Conventions that they really de≈øire the common ≈øafety, and would by no means
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50833:129"/> do any thing contrary thereunto; ≈øo likewi≈øe in making this compact, that what≈øoever they have ≈øo agreed to, they are ≈øtill to be ≈øuppo≈øed to have that intention, that nothing ≈øhould be done by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of tho≈øe conditions or parts which ≈øhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the common ≈øafety, and publick utility, or whereby the Convul≈øion or Di≈ø≈øolution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth might follow. But if ≈øuch a chance ≈øhould happen, it would be mo≈øt convenient, that if the affair will allow of delay, it ≈øhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed in the A≈ø≈øembly of E≈øtates, but where this cannot be done, it may be the Kings Duty dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly to correct tho≈øe complaints that may break out to the de≈øtruction of the Common-wealth, which al≈øo is of the the ≈øame force in re≈øpect of publick Laws, <note place="margin">

               <p>However, Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> will allow no di≈øtinction between limited power and ab≈øolute, but will have all ≈øupreme power to be ab≈øolute, when it is to be ob≈øerved, that in all tho≈øe a≈ø≈øertions which are too rudely laid down by him, there is a re≈øtriction to be added from the and of all Common-wealths, as in what he lays down in his <hi>de Cive cap.</hi> 5. ¬ß. 6. that he to whom in a Common-wealth there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the right of puni≈øhing, can by right compel all to all things he plea≈øes, or as he expre≈ø≈øes this limitation in the ≈øame place, which are nece≈ø≈øary for the common peace and ≈øafety, and <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. ¬ß. 13. when by the right of the ≈øupreme Governour he ≈øays there is connected ≈øo great an obedience of all the Subjects as is requi≈øite for the Government of the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50833:129"/> Common-wealth, ≈øo when in the place aforegoing he ≈øaith, who ever hath ≈øo ≈øubjected his own will <q rend="inline">'to that of the Prince, that he may do whatever he plea≈øes, without puni≈øhment, as al≈øo make Laws, Judg differences, puni≈øh whom he plea≈øes, &amp; u≈øe the ≈øtrength &amp; power of all men according to his own will, perform all the≈øe things by the highe≈øt right, he hath then granted him the greate≈øt power which can be granted.</q> But it is now to be con≈øidered, by what intention, or on what grounds men were moved to in≈øtitute Common-wealths, from whence it is clear, that no body is under≈øtood to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred more power by his Will upon the Monarch, then a rea≈øonable man can judg nece≈ø≈øary to that end: and that although the ordering what may conduce to this end in this or that occa≈øion, does not remain in tho≈øe that have transferred their power, but in him on whom that power is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, therefore the ≈øupream Ruler can compel the Subjects to all tho≈øe things which are really condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to the good of the Common-wealth, but he ought not to go about to compel them to tho≈øe things that are contrary to the ≈øafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or again≈øt the Laws of Nature. And if he endeavours any ≈øuch thing, without doubt he tran≈øgre≈ø≈øes the bounds of his power. Let us al≈øo con≈øider the Arguments by which the ≈øame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his <hi>De Cive. Cap.</hi> 6, ¬ß. 17. endeavours to prove that all limitation of Soveraign power is ab≈øolutely vain, he ≈øays that a≈ø≈øembly which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed the Laws to the future King, mu≈øt have had ab≈øolute power, either habitually, or vertually. If the A≈ø≈øembly remains con≈øtantly, or adjourns their Meeting from Time to Time, to a certain day and place, their power will be perpetual, and ≈øo the King will not have the Supream power, but will be
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50833:130"/> only a bare Magi≈øtrate. Which we grant to be true, if that A≈ø≈øembly can meet by its own Right and Decree of any Affairs of the Common-wealth, and that the King be liable to give them an Account of his Actions. But if it ab≈øolutely di≈ø≈øolve it ≈øelf; unle≈øs the Commonwealth be likewi≈øe di≈ø≈øolved, there mu≈øt in like manner a power be left ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, of puni≈øhing tho≈øe that tran≈øgre≈øs the Laws, which without ab≈øolute power cannot be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which is fal≈øe as al≈øo the Argument by which he would prove it: for he who hath granted him by Right, ≈øo much power, that he can compel any of the Subjects by puni≈øhments, hath ≈øo great power that greater cannot be conferred by them. But for all this, whoever will but con≈øider the end of all Common-wealths, and that tho≈øe Subjects by the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of their Wills and powers, did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately become ≈øencele≈øs Machines: ≈øo that ≈øince they could grant the u≈øe of their united Forces to another upon condition, and are able to judg whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this condition be perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So far ≈øpeaks the judicious Mr. <hi>Pu≈øendorf</hi> upon this Subject, which though ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prolix, I have thought fit to tran≈ølate verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becau≈øe I would not be thought by going about to contract it, to put my own ≈øence upon his words, and be≈øides I know no man that hath writ more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this Subject, in avoiding on one ≈øide an ab≈øolute de≈øpotick Monarchy, without falling into that Solaci≈øm in Politicks the divi≈øion of the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power which he ≈øuppo≈øes truly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtant with Monarchy. So that if the Reader is not ≈øatisfied with what I have here writ upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: I am ≈øorry his under≈øtanding and mine are not framed alike, nor ≈øhall be angry with him, if he like an ab≈øolute Monarchy better then that we live under. Provided, he will never Act any thing to produce publick di≈øturbances: or to introduce it, either by force or fraud in this Kingdom. Yet ≈øhall wi≈øh him no greater Prerogative, then that of enjoying his own opinion, without impo≈øing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, who are not yet weary of their E≈øtates and Liberties, which ≈øince the People of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not yet weary of.
